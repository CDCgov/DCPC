At around that time, he was involved in a minor motor vehicle collision and left the scene of the accident. Police reportedly found him confused. Both his family physician and a visiting nurse found his home in disarray. During a visit from his daughter, she noticed he was having minor word-finding difficulties. He was admitted to hospital in St. Mary's and underwent a CT scan of the head, which revealed a ring-enhancing left frontotemporal mass. The CT also showed edema and midline shift, but no hemorrhage. A chest x-ray revealed no abnormalities.\n\nMr. Burns was referred to the neurosurgery service and admitted to University HOSPITAL on 8 January 2016. A regimen of dexamethasone was started. He was seen in consultation by his neuro-oncologist the next day. There was no reported history of headache, seizures, vomiting, or falls. There was no reported family history of brain tumour. His neuro-oncologist found fluent aphasia on exam and raised suspicion of a primary, high-grade glioma. An MRI of the head was obtained on 10 January 2016. The reporting radiologist described irregular rim-enhancing lesions in the left insula and temporal lobe causing local mass effect. The lesion involving the insula measured 36 x 48 mm in the axial plane. .\n\nMr. Burns was discharged on 13 January 2016, with a plan to undergo surgical biopsy on 20 January 2016. He died prior to this appointment.\n\nGross Description at Autopsy:\n\nThe unfixed brain weight is 1709 grams. Externally, the brain is diffusely swollen with flattening gyri and effacement of sulci  The brain has been removed and fixed in formalin for further examination.\n\nGross Description at Brain Cutting:\n\nExamination of the formalin-fixed brain shows a swollen brain with left uncal grooving but no definite tonsillar herniation is noted. There is acute subarachnoid congestion with softening of left frontal region resulting in artifactual tissue fragmentation at the surface. Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages were observed on the superior cerebellum. On slicing the brain, a hemorrhagic, necrotic ill-defined mass is noted, involving the left frontal lobe, insula and basal ganglia. There is hemorrhage within the tumor with extension into the left parietal lobe and left lateral ventricle. A large clot weighing 70 grams is found in the left lateral ventricle, appearing to originate from tumour. The left temporal lobe and left thalamus are edematous and distorted by the mass. There is a left-to-right midline shift and transtentorial herniation on the left side. The midbrain appears compressed and there is a hemorrhage consistent with Duret hemorrhage.\n\nThe following sections have been taken for histology: B1-left superior frontal gyrus; B2-left frontal periventricular region; B3-right temporal; B4-left anterior cingulate; B5-tumor in left basal ganglia; B6-right amygdala; B7-right hippocampus; B8-right thalamus; B9-right calcarine; B10-right vermis; B11-pons; B12-left cerebellar hemisphere with dentate; B13-medulla; B14-midbrain; B15-hemorrhagic tumor.\n\nMicroscopic Description:\n\nLeptomeninges:\n- no obvious tumor seen\n\nCerebral cortex and white matter: \nFrontal (left superior frontal gyrus), : \n- neurofibrillary tangles, infrequent\n- amyloid plaques (with some core plaques); moderate\n- thickened, hyalinized vessels (arteriolosclerosis), white matter\n\n\nTemporal, right: \n- neurofibrillary tangles, infrequent to moderate\n- amyloid plaques (mostly plaques); moderate\n\n- thickened, hyalinized vessels (arteriolosclerosis), white matter\n\nOccipital (calcarine and pericalcarine): \n-unremarkable\n\nCingulate, left anterior and corpus callosum: \n- unremarkable cingulate cortex\n- astrocytosis, corpus callosum\n\nHippocampus and parahippocampus: \n- scattered shrunken neurons; CA1\n- moderate neurofibrillary tangles; CA1, entorhinal cortex and occipitotemporal (tauPHF)\n- neuropil threads, moderate in entorhinal cortex (tauPHF)\n- amyloid plaques; infrequent in entorhinal cortex and occipitotemporal (beta-amyloid)\n- TDP-43 unremarkable\n\nAmygdala: \n- neurofibrillary tangles; infrequent in amygdala, moderate in adjacent entorhinal cortex (tauPHF)\n- neuropil threads, adjacent entorhinal cortex (tauPHF)\n- amyloid plaques; infrequent in amygdala and adjacent entorhinal cortex (beta-amyloid)\n- no Lewy bodies (alpha-synuclein)\n\nPeriventricular white matter (left frontal) \n- thickened, hyalinized vessels (arteriolosclerosis)\n\nTumor, left frontal and left basal ganglia:\n- atypical elongated nuclei, infiltrative\n- endothelial proliferation\n- pseudopalisading as well as infarctive necrosis\n- large vessels with thickened hyalinized wall \n- acute hemorrhages in tumor\n- tumor immmunopositive for GFAP, p53, Ki-67 (scattered nuclei); immunonegative for IDH-1 and partially for ATRX (loss of nuclear expression)\n\nBasal ganglia and thalamus:\nBasal ganglia, left: \n- infiltrated by tumor (see above)\n\nThalamus, right : \n- astrocytosis\n- vessels with thickened hyalinized wall (arteriolosclerosis)\n\nBrain stem:\nMidbrain: \n- midline hemorrhage and tegmentum (Duret hemorrhage)\n\nPons: \n- unremarkable.\n\nMedulla: \n- unremarkable.\n\nCerebellum:\nCerebellar vermis (superior)\n- unremarkable.\n\nCerebellar hemisphere, left: \n- left dentate nuclei unremarkable.\n\n \nNeuropathological Diagnosis:\n\n1.

His wife died recently (December 2015). As well, Mr. Burns had a minor motor vehicle collision and was found having left the scene confused. A CT, during subsequent workup for confusion, revealed a ring enhancing mass of the left temporal insular area. He was transferred from ------ to ------- in ------ on -------, 2016 for further workup. Course in hospital confirmed the presence of an intracranial tumor. He was preparing to be transferred back to St. Mary's hospital while waiting for a biopsy. During transfer he became unresponsive and was returned to University HOSPITAL where a head CT revealed an additional 8 x 4 cm intracerebral hemorrhage with midline shift. Mr. Burns was made palliative and pronounced dead on January 13, 2016. \n\nPast medical history includes: \n- history of left knee surgery x 2 (20 years ago)\n- hypertension\n- high cholesterol\n\nExternal Examination\n\nClothing \\T\\ Effects: the body was received in a body bag with arms bound with a white band, wearing adult diaper\n\nHeight: 178 cm\nWeight: 88 kg\nBody Habitus: BMI = 27.8 kg/m?\nRigor Mortis: dependant (blanching)\nLivor Mortis: minimal\n\nScalp/Hair: short grey scalp hair with male pattern baldness\nEyes: Iris Colour: brown Pupil Diameter: 0.3 cm bilaterally Sclera/Conjunctiva: unremarkable\nFace: unremarkable\nLips, Teeth, Mouth: natural upper and lower teeth\n\nNeck: unremarkable\nTorso: unremarkable\nBreasts: unremarkable\nExtremities: \n- linear scar, 4 cm, right groin\n- linear scar, 4.5 cm, right inner leg\n- linear scar, 4 cm, right inner leg\n- linear scar, 6.5 cm, right inner leg\n- linear scar, 12 cm, right inner leg\n- linear scar, 6 cm, right inner leg\n- linear scar, 6 cm, right inner leg\n- multiple linear scars (x3), 1.5 to 4 cm, left right knee\n- linear scar, 6.5 cm, left knee\n- linear scar, 5.5 cm, left elbow\n\nExternal Genitalia / Anus: unremarkable\n\nSkin Features (general): unremarkable\n\n\nSigns Of Recent Therapeutic/Diagnostic Intervention\n\nPuncture x 1, left index finger, covered in bandage\nPuncture x 1, right radial dorsal wrist, covered with gauze\n\nInjury Description \n\nExternal Features: \n- bruise, 3 x 2 cm, right shoulder\n- bruise, 5 x 2.5 cm, midline chest\n- abrasion, 1 cm, left elbow\n- abrasion, 11 x 0.4 cm, left shin\n- bruise, 1.5 x 1 cm, right calf\n\nInternal Features: None\n\n\nInternal Examination\n\n\nBody Cavities\n\nPericardium \\T\\ Cavity: unremarkable\nPleura \\T\\ Cavities: unremarkable, no fluid\nPeritoneum \\T\\ Cavity: unremarkable, no fluid\nMediastinum: unremarkable\nRetroperitoneum: unremarkable\n\n\nCardiovascular System \n\nHeart Weight: 410 grams\nCoronary Arteries: moderate to severe atherosclerosis of the left anterior and circumflex arteries requiring decalcification, minimal atherosclerosis of the right coronary artery\nAtria: not dilated, no mural thrombi\nRight Ventricle (Including Thickness): 0.3 cm myocardial thickness\nLeft Ventricle (Including Thickness): 1.4 cm myocardial thickness\nCardiac Valves:  TV = 9 cm, unremarkable  PV = 7 cm, unremarkable  MV = 9 cm, unremarkable  AV = 7 cm, unremarkable\nAorta \\T\\ Major Arteries: moderate to severe atherosclerotic plaques within the aorta\nVena Cavae \\T\\ Major Veins: unremarkable\n\n\nNeck And Respiratory System\n\nSoft Tissues Of Neck: unremarkable\nLarynx: unremarkable\nTrachea: unremarkable\nBronchi \\T\\ Carina: unremarkable\nLungs: \nR = 452 grams, congested\nL = 377 grams, congested\nPulmonary Vessels: unremarkable, no thromboemboli\nDiaphragm: unremarkable\n\n\nDigestive System\n\nPharynx/Esophagus: unremarkable\nStomach Contents: 500 ml of partially digested food\nGastric Mucosa/Wall: unremarkable, mucosa intact\nIntestines: unremarkable on opening\nVermiform Appendix: present\nMesentery: unremarkable\nLiver: 1,775 grams, unremarkable\nGallbladder/Biliary System: present, unremarkable\nPancreas: 185 grams, unremarkable\n\n\nGenitourinary System\n\nKidneys: \nR = 176 grams with cortical granularity\nL = 183 grams with cortical granularity\nUreters: unremarkable\nUrinary Bladder: distended with 800 ml urine\nUrine: 31 grams, unremarkable\nProstate: 36 grams, unremarkable\nTestes: \nR = 36 grams, unremarkable\nL = 35 grams, unremarkable\n\n\nLymphoid ?
