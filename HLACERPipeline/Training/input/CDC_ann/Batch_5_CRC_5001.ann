The result will be provided in a separate report.\n\nThis case has been reviewed at Departmental Gastrointestinal Pathology Rounds (with Drs. Chakrabarti, Driman, Parfitt, and Walsh). All agree that the colonic tumour is an adenosquamous carcinoma, and that the liver metastasis is a low grade adenocarcinoma with mucinous features.\n\nThank you for your consultation.

Had Rt hemicolectomy March 20/16. For review. Extended RAS mutation analysis also requested.\n\n\nPath report.microscopic observation\n\n\nThe LRCP consultation report was reviewed in order to determine the reason for review. The report indicates that the intention of the review is clarification of the histological diagnosis of the colon and liver tumour.\n\nSections are cut from each paraffin block and stained with H\\T\\E. In addition on block B9, elastic trichrome, alcian blue, and PASD stains and immunostains for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, cytokeratin 5/6, CDX-2, and p63 were done. On block B10, an elastic trichrome stain and immunostains for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63 were performed.\n\nA: The slides show a small wedge biopsy composed entirely of low grade adenocarcinoma with mucinous features. There is no recognizable liver tissue. The tumour consists of columnar cells arranged in medium to large glands, some showing a cribriform pattern. The malignant cells also line large pools of extracellular mucin. \"Dirty\" tumour necrosis is noted. The malignant cells have moderately pleomorphic nuclei. The histological features are typical for colorectal origin.\n\nB: The colonic tumour is an adenosquamous carcinoma. These tumours are not usually graded. The tumour is arising in a villous adenoma. There is a minor component of low grade adenocarcinoma with mucinous features, similar to the liver metastasis (specimen A). The tumour invades through the muscularis propria into the subserosa and pericolic tissue, with no evidence of serosal involvement. Focal lymphovascular and extramural venous invasion is present, the latter identified focally with an elastic trichrome stain. The resection margins and 20 lymph nodes are negative for malignancy. The presence of acid and neutral mucin in the adenocarcinoma component is identified with alcian blue and PASD stains respectively. The squamous component is strongly positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63. Scattered cells in both components are strongly positive for cytokeratin 20. The tumour is negative for cytokeratin 7 and CDX-2 in the sections stained.\n\n\n"
