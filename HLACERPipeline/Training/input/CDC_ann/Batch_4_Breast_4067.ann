The external surface is marked with blue ink. Serially sectioning the tissue reveals a 1.0 x 0.8 cm area of gray-white, indurated tissue extending to the resection margin. The indurated tissue occupies approximately 70-75% of the cut surface. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes 1A-1B. 1A, 3/1; 1B, 2/1.

Sunshine in Dr. 's office was notified of the diagnosis at 1:16 p.m. CST on 08/23/2017. FISH Comments - The HER2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) did not reveal amplification of the HER2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 1.16 and a Her2 copy number of 2.04, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. There was no evidence of polysomy/polyploidy or genetic heterogeneity. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
