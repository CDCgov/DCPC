The specimen is received opened and the resection margins are stapled. The mucosa is tan and glistening with edematous folds. A tan solid rubbery irregular polypoid mass (8.8 x 5.2 x 4.3 cm) involves the cecum and ileocecal valve. The mass is 4.7 cm from the proximal, 4.5 cm from the distal, and 5.3 cm from the radial resection margins. The mass is 1.4 cm from the serosa and does not appear to extend through the colon wall into the mesentery. The appendiceal orifice is occluded by the mass, but the mass does not extend into the appendix. The appendix is otherwise unremarkable. No other nodules, masses or lesions are identified. Multiple possible lymph nodes (0.1 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm-2.2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm) are identified. Ink code: black-resection margin; blue-serosa. Section code: (A1) proximal resection margin, longitudinally sectioned, representative; (A2) distal resection margin, longitudinally sectioned, representative; (A3) radial resection margin, representative; (A4) mass with serosa, serially sectioned, representative; (A5) mass with ileocecal valve, longitudinally sectioned, representative; (A6) mass with appendiceal orifice, representative; (A7-A10) mass, one full-thickness section; (A11) appendix, representative; (A12-A14) multiple intact lymph nodes; (A15, A16) two bisected lymph nodes in each cassette; (A17, A18) one bisected lymph node in each cassette.
