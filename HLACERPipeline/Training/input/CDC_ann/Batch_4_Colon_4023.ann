The appendix is not identified on the cecum or within the specimen container. Both of the resection margins are closed with a staple line. Opening the bowel reveals a pink-tan centrally ulcerated mass (3.2 cm in length x 3.5 cm in diameter). The mass lies 11.5 cm from the distal resection margin and 10.0 cm from the proximal resection margin. The mass lacks approximately 0.5 cm from being circumferential. Serially sectioning this area reveals apparent invasion through the muscularis propria and possibly into the underlying adipose tissue. The mesenteric margin closest to the mass is marked with blue ink. This margin is at least 6.0 cm from the mass. There is a 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm polypoid lesion lying 1.0 cm distal to the mass. No definite invasion is identified on the cut surface of this polyp. There is an additional multilobulated sessile polypoid lesion (2.5 x 2.0 cm) lying 3.5 cm proximal to the mass and 5.5 cm from the proximal resection margin. No definite invasion is identified on the cut surface of this polyp. Within the cecal pouch is an additional sessile polyp (1.0 x 0.8 cm), lying 6.5 cm from the proximal resection margin. No other gross abnormalities are identified on the mucosal surface. Sectioning the attached adipose tissue reveals 16 possible red-brown lymph nodes (0.2 to 0.6 cm in maximum dimension). Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A, proximal resection margin, 1/1; 1B, distal resection margin, 1/1; 1C-1E, mass at the point of deepest invasion, 1/1 each; 1F, mass with adjacent uninvolved proximal mucosa, 1/1; 1G, mass with adjacent distal mucosa, 1/1; 1H, mesenteric margin closest to the mass, 1/1; 1I, polypoid lesion distal to the mass, 2/1; 1J-1K, multilobulated polypoid lesion just proximal to the mass, 2/1 each; 1L, polypoid lesion within the cecum, 2/1; 1M-1O, possible lymph nodes, 1M is 6/1; 1N-1O are 5/1 each.
