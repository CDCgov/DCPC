The terminal ileum is 3.5 cm in length with an average circumference of 4.0 cm, the cecum with colon is 17.0 cm in length with a varying circumference ranging from 6.2 cm along the distal margin, up to 11.5 cm near the ileocecal valve. The segment of colon is slightly adherent to itself from closer to the ileocecal valve to the mid portion of the segment along 1 side. There are a total of 3 lesions found within the cecum and right colon. The first lesion found within the cecum is exophytic, pink-tan to yellow polypoid and measures 6.5 x 4.6 cm. The lesion is adjacent to the ileocecal valve and extends up to 3.0 cm from the proximal margin and 9.4 cm from the distal margin. Upon sectioning, the lesion varies in thickness ranging from 0.7 cm up to 2.2 cm. There are focal areas of gross invasion into the underlying wall. This first lesion is approximately 7.0 cm from the resected margin. Please note further sectioning within the area of the appendiceal orifice reveals no attached appendix. Further sectioning reveals puckering along the adjacent serosal surface within the area of the first lesion. Approximately 1.5 cm distal to the first lesion is a second pink-tan polypoid exophytic lesion, 5.0 x 3.1 cm found to be 12.5 cm from the distal margin. Upon sectioning, the second lesion varies in thickness from 0.7 cm up to 1.2 cm with focal areas of gross invasion into the underlying wall. Found 2.5 cm from the second lesion is a third pink-tan centrally ulcerated lesion with heaped up borders that appears to be circumferential and measures 8.2 x 4.4 cm, this lesion is found to be 7.0 cm from the distal margin. Upon sectioning, the third lesion varies in thickness from 0.7 cm up to 2.2 cm with gross invasion into the underlying fatty tissue. The third lesion is approximately 6.0 cm from the resected radial margin. Further sectioning reveals the area of underlying fatty tissue gross invasion is adjacent to where this area of colon is adherent to itself along the opposing side. Please note, however gross invasion into the underlying site (this area is adjacent to the first lesion) is not evident. Sectioning of the surrounding subserosal adipose tissue reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.4 cm up to 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. One area displays possible lymph node matting, this area measures 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.

Smaller 2 tumors show at least portions which have a mucinous component.   Larger tumor is more poorly differentiated and higher grade.   Minimal satellitosis and no lymphovascular or perineural invasion identified.   Surgical margins of resection are negative for tumor.   Closest margin is serosal at 1.5 mm.   One of thirty-one lymph nodes involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.   (See 17-GI-15572).
