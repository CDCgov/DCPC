COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing.\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nFISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a PIK3CA (3q26) gene amplification. While the PIK3CA/RPN1 ratio was 1.11, 29% of cells had 6 or more copies of PIK3CA with an average copy number of 6.86. PIK3CA (3q26) is an oncogene whose increased activity via activating mutations and/or gene amplification have been described in many cancers including ovarian, cervical , brain, breast, thyroid and colorectal cancers, among others. PIK3CA amplification may be responsive to phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase inhibitors.    FISH revealed no evidence of MET (7q31.2) gene amplification. The MET/CEP7 ratio was 1.03. However, 1-5 additional copies of MET and CEP7 were detected in 86% of cells analyzed, suggesting the presence of polysomy of chromosome 7.    FISH revealed no evidence of deletion of PTEN (10q23). However, additional copies of PTEN and CEP10 were detected in 45% of cells analyzed, suggesting the presence of polysomy of chromosome 10.    FISH revealed no evidence of deletion of TP53 (17p13.1) or NF1 (17q11.2). However, 1-3 additional copies of NF1 were detected in 76% of cells analyzed. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.    FISH revealed no evidence of HER2 (17q12) gene amplification. The HER2/CEP17 ratio was 1.09. However, 1-3 additional copies of HER2 and CEP17 were detected in 49% of cells analyzed.    Overall, these results are indicative of a complex abnormal karyotype (3 or more abnormalities) likely predicting for a rapid disease progression and a poor treatment outcome. Monitoring for these anomalies may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.    It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.    FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  CEP7/MET (Centromere 7/7q31) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  CEP17/HER2 (Centromere 17/17q12) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  CEP10/PTEN (Centromere 10/10q23) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  RPN1/PIK3CA (3q21/3q26) (MetaSystems Group Inc., Newton, MA)  TP53/NF1 (17p13.1/17q11.2) (MetaSystems Group Inc., Newton, MA)    References:  Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2010, 2(1): a001008; Oncotarget. 2014, 5(15): 5873 5892; J Clin Pathol. 2015, 68(4):253-7; World J Biol Chem. 2015, 6(2):16-27; Mol Biol Int. 2014, 2014:852748; Int J Oncol. 2012, 40(3):639-44; Clin Cancer Res. 2010, 16(17):4325-30.  Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and total RNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated RNA was subjected to reverse transcription, and double stranded DNA was constructed. The specimen was universal-tagged and barcoded, and subjected to hemi-nested multiplex PCR using gene-specific primers and universal tag specific primers (Archer FusionPlex chemistry). The products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using Archer Analysis Software, v4.1. The analytic sensitivity is approximately 5 RNA molecules encoding the fusion, and is dependent on the specific fusion event present. All fusions are relative to the reported reference transcript. This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.<br/><br/>The following genes analyzed, including specific exons and direction of analysis, are listed in the table at the end of this report.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaye, Mol Cancer There 8.6(2009):1399-1408; Mitelman, et al., Nature Rev Cancer 7(2007): 233-245; Parker; -Sinha, et al., Genome Medicine 7(2015): 129; Cantwell-Dorris et al.

Sufficient tumor tissue is present for molecular analysis. Excellent gene coverage was achieved, which passed our internal quality checks. <strong>TP53 E180K and CXCR4 S2P mutations were detected</strong> by targeted next generation sequencing. No other mutations were detected by targeted next generation sequencing interrogating the hot-spot regions of the genes summarized in the NGS gene table. In particular, no mutations were detected in BRAF, EGFR, KRAS or NRAS. </p> <p>The TP53 gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein containing transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains. The encoded protein responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. Mutations in TP53 are associated with a variety of human cancers, including hereditary cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and are generally associated with a poor prognosis. Therapies directly or indirectly targeting TP53 may be available in an investigational context. </p> <p>CXCR4 gene encodes a CXC chemokine receptor specific for stromal cell-derived factor-1. The protein has 7 transmembrane regions and is located on the cell surface. It acts with the CD4 protein to support HIV entry into cells and is also highly expressed in breast cancer cells. Mutations in this gene have been associated with WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis) syndrome. <strong>Of note, this particular CXCR4 S2P alteration is not referenced in the cancer (COSMIC) database. Thus, its clinical significance in this context is unclear.</strong></p>  ## End of auxiliary report ## Fish Report: FISH - - Positive for PIK3CA gene amplification.  - Positive for polysomy of chromosome 7 and 10.  - Positive for additional copies of NF1, CEP17, and HER2.  - Negative for MET and HER2 gene amplification.  - Negative for deletion of PTEN, NF1, and TP53.   ## End of auxiliary report ## Smart Genomics ACGH: SGCGH Impression - <p>Cytogenomic array analysis revealed a<strong> complex cytogenomic karyotype </strong>with<strong> amplification on 3q (including PIK3CA) </strong>and multiple genomic changes including a 1-2 copy gain of the entire genome indicative of hypertriploid/hypotetraploid karyotype (see technical details and cytogenomic karyotype below). <strong>These findings are indicative of the presence of a neoplastic cell population.</strong></p> <p>The pathology report indicates adenosquamous carcinoma (see pathology report under the referenced accession). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a PIK3CA (3q26) gene amplification, as well as additional copies of MET and CEP7 were detected in 86% of cells, additional copies of PTEN and CEP10 in 45% of cells analyzed, additional copies of NF1 (17q11.2) in 76% of cells analyzed, and additional copies of HER2 (17q12) and CEP17 were detected in 49% of cells analyzed (see FISH report). </p> <p>In general, a complex karyotype is associated with a poor prognosis in many cancers. Specifically, gain on 1q, 5p, 7q, 8q, 10q and 12p are common alterations seen in various cancers, including lung neoplasms, which have been associated with distant metastasis and poor prognosis. Targeted therapies for amplification of PIK3CA (i.e., PI3K or AKT inhibitors) may be available in an investigational setting.</p> <p>Examples of clinical trials for which this patient may be eligible are listed below.</p> <p><strong>Correlation with other clinical and morphological findings is recommended.</strong></p>  ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - Adenosquamous Carcinoma\n\n\n"
