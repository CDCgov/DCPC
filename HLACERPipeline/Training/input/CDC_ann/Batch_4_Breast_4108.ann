Located within the mid aspect of the breast is a 19.5 x 8.4 cm pink-tan wrinkled skin ellipse containing an eccentrically located areolar complex (that approaches 10-o'clock) measuring 3.0 cm in diameter with a 0.7 cm in diameter inverted nipple. The skin surface 7-o'clock from the nipple displays a 0.3 cm in greatest dimension area of erythema. The remainder of the skin surface is grossly unremarkable. No puncture marks or lesions are otherwise identified. The deep fascial plane is mostly smooth with an area approaching the medial margin displaying adherent cauterized fibrinous capsular tissue. The margins are inked as follows: Superficial superior is blue, superficial inferior is green, deep is inked black. Serially sectioning medial to lateral reveals the fibrinous area, measuring 4.5 x 3.4 x 2.0 cm containing old brown hemorrhagic soft material grossly consistent with previous site of excision. The fibrinous capsule is thickened and extends up to the deep fascial plane, 2.0 cm from the nearest superficial inferior margin and approximately 0.5 cm from the nearest superficial superior margin. The remainder of the breast is comprised of lobulated fatty breast tissue with areas of rubbery tan- white fibrous tissue scattered throughout. No secondary lesions are grossly identified. Summary of sections: 1A, nipple serially sectioned, 4/1; 1B, fibrinous capsular cavity with nearest superficial inferior margin and deep margin, 1/1; 1C, nearest superficial superior margin, 1/1; 1D-1F, sections of cavity, 1D, 1/1; 1E, 2/1; 1F, 1/1; 1G, most medial margin from biopsy cavity, 1/1; 1H, sections from upper outer quadrant, 2/1; 1I, sections from upper inner quadrant, 2/1; 1J, sections from lower inner quadrant, 2/1; 1K, sections from lower outer quadrant, 2/1; 1L, section from mid aspect of breast, 2/1.
