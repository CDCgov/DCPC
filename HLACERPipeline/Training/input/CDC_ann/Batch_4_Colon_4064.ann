The tumor is morphologically consistent with metastasis from a colon primary. Additional testing can be performed if requested. Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.  This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: exons 10 and 14, consisting of codons 464 to 472 and 581 to 601 (specifically including codon V600).  <BR/><BR/>Cohen, Yoram, et al.<i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i> 95.8 (2003): 625-627.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist and representative areas of tumor and normal tissue selected. These areas were microdissected from the surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA extracted using standard methods (QIAGEN QIASymphony). The tumor and normal DNA were separately PCR amplified for five microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27; Promega Corp.), and size fractionated via capillary electrophoresis (Life Technologies 3500xl). The tumor and normal profiles were compared to determine the presence of altered microsatellite profiles. The analytic sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10-20% and is dependent on the size and clonality of any instability. The presence of instability in less than 10-20% of the DNA examined will not be detected. This assay uses reagents that may be marked as Research Use Only or Analyte Specific Reagent.
