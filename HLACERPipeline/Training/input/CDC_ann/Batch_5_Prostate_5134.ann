PROSTATE BIOPSY - RIGHT BASE: Sections demonstrate three (3) cores of tissue with a solitary focus of approximately 8-10 atypical glands without a dual cell layer either histologically or immunohistochemical. The respective glands are lined by cells with variable amounts of amphophilic and clear cytoplasm with round vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli, focally. Perineural invasion is not identified. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is not seen.\n\nThis adenocarcinoma fits the definition of minimal (limited) carcinoma based on extent (i.e., one site, less than 5% of core tissue and/or less than 1 mm linear extent) and grade (<= Gleason score 6). Some patients with minimal carcinoma who undergo radical prostatectomy are found to have potentially \"clinically significant\" cancers. Nevertheless, many minimal carcinomas are truly limited and may be difficult or impossible to find in the radical prostatectomy specimen for number of valid reasons. \n\nThis case has been reviewed by Dr. M. Bishara who concurs with the histological and immunohistochemical assessment and diagnosis. \n \nB. PROSTATE BIOPSY - RIGHT MID: Sections of two (2) cores of tissue with glands lined by a dual cell layer both histologically and immunohistochemically. However, in a single focus, approximately 4-5 glands with cytoplasmic immunostaining for racemase but without a basal cell layer either histologically or by special stains are seen. Elsewhere, corpora amylacea as well as both sclerosing and cystic atrophy are identified. Perineural invasion is not identified. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is not seen.\n\nAlthough the presence of 4-5 atypical glands may be suspicious for malignancy, the limited number of these structures precludes a definitive diagnosis. As such, the most appropriate diagnosis is a small acinar proliferation of undetermined significance (ASAPUS) and a repeat biopsy of the area within three (3) months may be considered, if clinically warranted.\n\nThis case has been reviewed by Dr. M. Bishara who concurs with the histological and immunohistochemical assessment and diagnosis. \n\nC. PROSTATE BIOPSY - RIGHT APEX: Sections demonstrate three (3) cores of tissue with glands lined by a dual cell layer, both histologically and immunohistochemically. In a solitary focus, neutrophils are seen within the lumina of several glands. Lymphoid aggregates are identified in the stroma. Elsewhere, corpora amylacea and microcalcifications are seen. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is not identified.\n\nThere is no malignancy. \n \nThis case has been reviewed by Dr. D. Melega who concurs with the histological and immunohistochemical assessment and diagnosis.\n \nD. PROSTATE BIOPSY - LEFT BASE: Sections demonstrate three (3) cores of tissue with glands lined by a dual cell layer. Sclerosing atrophy and corpora amylacea are seen. High-grade prosthetic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is not identified.\n\nThere is no malignancy. \n \nE. PROSTATE BIOPSY - LEFT MID: Sections demonstrate two (2) cores of tissue with glands lined by a dual cell layer both histologically and by special stains.

Melega who concurs with the histological and immunohistochemical assessment and diagnosis.\n\nF. PROSTATE BIOPSY - LEFT APEX: Sections of two (2) cores of tissue show glands lined by a dual cell layer both histologically or by special stains. In a solitary focus; however, approximately 4-5 glands fail to demonstrate a basal cell layer either histologically or immunohistochemically. Perineural invasion is not seen. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) is not identified. Elsewhere, microcalcifications as well as chronic inflammation and acute prostatitis are seen.\n\nAlthough the presence of 4-5 atypical glands may be suspicious for malignancy, the limited number of these structures precludes a definitive diagnosis.

One of the two cores with your dots contains several small acinar proliferations with some small nucleoli and a somewhat \"infiltrative\" pattern. My differential is between ASAP and benign. There are a few positive staining basal cells in a couple of structures which would ordinarily put it in the benign category. Others have some cytoplasmic Racemase staining. I am leaning towards calling this biopsy ASAPUS; admittedly, this is subjective. Anything more concerning elsewhere in the biopsy?\n\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n\n"
