Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) Report ALK Analysis RESULT:   No Evidence of ALK Gene Rearrangement Detected by FISH Special studies report received from Integrated Oncology, 5005 S. 40th Street, Suite 1100, Phoenix, AZ, 85040, on case, labeled with their number , dated 06/10/2017. EGFR Gene Mutation Analysis INTERPRETATION:   Positive in exon 19 for a deletion mutation. Indication for Study:   Adenocarcinoma Specimen Site and Type:   Paraffin-Embedded Tissue-Left Lung Nucleotide Change:   Exon 19 Partial Deletion Mutation Amino Acid Change:   Amino Acid Deletion Comments: A deletion mutation was detected within exon 19 of the EGFR gene. This mutation is correlated with responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory findings for the most accurate interpretation. This assay does not distinguish between the 18bp insertion and deletions at nucleotide position 2235 and 2237. A subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has shown clinical responsiveness to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors gefitinib (IRESSA) and erlotinib (Tarceva), including never smokers, individuals of Asian ethnicity, and those with adenocarcinoma histology. In the majority of patients with highly responsive tumors, the tumor contains a somatic mutation within the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. The presence of a somatic EGFR mutation is significantly associated with response to gefitinib and erlotinib, and is strongly predictive of prolonged survival in NSCLC patients.

Perry Chan, Ph.D., MBA DABMG, DABCC, DLMcm, M(ASCP)cm, MB(ASCP)cm Methodology: Genomic DNA was isolated from the provided tumor specimen. Exons 18 through 21 of the EGFR gene were subjected to SNaPShot multiplex PCR and primer extension for mutation detection. This assay is able to detect 2-20% mutation in a background of wild-type DNA.
