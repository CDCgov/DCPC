Specimen 1 is received fresh for frozen section in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"left distal ureter\" is a 0.4 cm long x 0.5 cm in diameter tan cylindrical structure which contains a small amount of attached fatty tissue. Excluding the fat, the entire cylindrical structure is examined by frozen section and submitted in cassette 1FSA. 2. Specimen 2 is received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"final left ureter\" is a 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm piece of soft tan tissue containing an attached plastic clip and suture. The specimen is submitted whole in cassette 2A. 3. Specimen 3 is received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"final right ureter\" is a 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.2 cm flatten piece of tan tissue with an attached large caliber plastic clip and a length of suture. The specimen is submitted whole in cassette 3A. 4. Specimen 4 is received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"omentum\" is a 3.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm portion of fatty tissue containing a 0.9 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm circumscribed nodule which has a friable brown parenchyma. The surrounding fat is unremarkable. Sections comprising the entire specimen are submitted. Cassette summary: 4A, sections comprising the entire friable nodule. 4B, remaining specimen. 5. Specimen 5 is received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"pelvic lymph nodes\" is a 5 x 3 x 1.5 cm aggregate of fatty tissue containing seven 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.2 to 3 x 1.5 x up to 1 cm yellow-tan and red-brown focally fat replaced candidate nodes. Cassette summary: 5A, 2 candidate lymph nodes submitted whole. 5B-5D, 1 candidate lymph node each bisected. 5E-5F, 1 candidate lymph node bisected. 5G-5H, 1 candidate lymph node bisected. 6. Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"bladder\" is a 5.5 x 4.5 x 4.7 cm bladder. The bladder contains an abundant amount of attached perivesicular fat. The anterior fat is inked blue and the posterior is inked black. The attached right ureter is 1.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter and the attached left ureter segment is 1 cm in length and 0.3 cm in diameter. The ureteral mucosa is soft and pink-tan. On section, the bladder mucosa has an edematous appearance and is pink-tan to red-brown. Within the area of the anterior and posterior wall, as well as the trigone is a 3 x 1.5 cm area of red and brown granularity with cautery artifacts suggestive of site of previous biopsy. On section, in this area is a 3 x 3 x 2.5 cm probable area of residual tumor which extends beyond the bladder wall encompassing the seminal vesicles. The tumor grossly extends to the inked posterior soft tissue margin. The tumor also extend to the inked right lateral bladder wall margin and is within 0.3 cm of the anterior soft tissue margin. The previously mentioned seminal vesicles are poorly delineated due to extensive tumor involvement. The perivesicular fatty tissue is sectioned and palpated and the lymph nodes are not observed. The attached prostate is 3.2 cm superior to inferior, 4 cm right to left and is up to 3.3 cm anterior to posterior. The prostate is inked as follows: anterior midline blue, posterior midline black, right half green and left half blue. The prostate is sectioned into 4 slices. On section, the prostate appears extensively involved by tumor involving both lobes. The probable tumor also appears to extend very close to the capsule bilaterally. Representative sections are submitted.
