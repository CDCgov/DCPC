The carcinoma is approximately 1.5 cm from the serosal surface separated by the inflammatory process and dense fibrous tissue. There is no reason to believe that this ever perforated or that viable tumour would have had access to the peritoneal cavity. Although no diverticular disease is described or seen, the muscular thickening and the presence of abscesses raises that possibility. Irrespective, the presence of absence of diverticular disease is not pertinent to the considerations of Dr. X. He was concerned whether tumour has potentially spread into the peritoneal cavity.\nThis has been a focussed examination based on the question posed by Dr. X.\nPM/pm.\n\n\n"
