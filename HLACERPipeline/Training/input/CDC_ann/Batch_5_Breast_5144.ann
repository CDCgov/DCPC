The specimen consists of\n   three yellow to tan-white fibrofatty to fibrofleshy core needle biopsy specimen\n   1.2 cm, 1.5 cm and 1.4 cm in length and each measuring up to 0.2 cm in\n   diameter. The entire specimen is submitted as follows: A1 two cores and A2\n   one core.\nB:  The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and as \"LEFT AXILLA\". The specimen consists of two fragments\n   of yellow-white core needle biopsy specimen measuring 1.7 cm and 1 cm in length\n   and each measuring up to 0.2 cm in diameter. The entire specimen is submitted\n   in cassette B1.\n                                        /KS\n\n\nTISSUE SUBMITTED\n\nBREAST BIOPSY (LEFT BREAST MASS 1 O'CLOCK )\nLYMPH NODE CORE BIOPSY (LEFT AXILLA)\n\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS\n\nA.  BREAST (LEFT, 1 O'CLOCK) CORE BIOPSY:\n   - INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA\nB.  LYMPH NODE (LEFT AXILLA) CORE BIOPSY:\n   - ADENOCARCINOMA\n   - LYMPH NODE TISSUE IS NOT IDENTIFIED (PLEASE SEE COMMENT)\nComment: Carcinoma in part B is better preserved but looks similar to that in part\nA, which shows some crush-type artefact. Lymph node structures are not seen in B and\nit can therefore not be determined if this represent nodal metastasis versus soft\ntissue involvement/metastasis versus other primary site.\nImmunostains were performed on part B due to better preserved tumour. Immunostain\nfor e-cadherin is positive, consistent with ductal type.\nImmunostains for ER PR and HER2 are reported separately in addendum report.\nInternal pathology consultation has been obtained, as documented internally.\n\n\nCLINICAL HISTORY\n\nRIGHT MASTECTOMY NOW LEFT BREAST MASS, ENLARGED LEFT AXILLARY NODE\n\n\n"
