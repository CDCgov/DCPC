The terminal ileum is 5.3 cm in length with a circumference of 3.8 cm. the mucosa is pink-tan with folds arranged in the usual manner. No abnormalities are grossly identified. The cecum and right colon, 24.5 cm in length has a varying circumference ranging from 7.0 cm near the distal margin, up to 13.0 cm near the ileocecal valve. Located 6.5 cm distal to the ileocecal valve is an area of mucosal puckering, 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. This area is grossly consistent with previous GI biopsy site. Also 5.1 cm distal to the area of puckering is tan-brown sessile polyp, 1.5 x 0.7 cm. This polyp is located 7.8 cm from the distal margin. Adjacent to the puckering site previously described is an area of submucosal fat deposition, 2.2 x 1.4 cm. The remainder of the cecum and right colon are comprised of pink-tan mucosal folds arranged in the usual manner. No other lesions or polyps are grossly identified. The wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. Sectioning of the surrounding fatty tissue reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.4 cm up to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Summary of sections: 1A, margins, 2/1; 1B-C, puckered mucosal area, B 3/1, C 2/1; 1D, sessile polyp distal to puckered mucosa, 2/1; 1E, section of submucosal fat deposition, 1/1; 1F, 4 lymph nodes, 4/1; 1G, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1H, 4 lymph nodes, 4/1; 1I, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1J, 3 lymph nodes, 3/1; 1K, sections of fatty tissue with adjacent vessels, M/1.

No evidence of residual polyp at above biopsy site location.   Adenomatous polyp, 5.1 cm distal to original biopsy site.   No evidence of high-grade epithelial dysplasia or malignancy.   Twenty-three regional lymph nodes negative for metastatic carcinoma.

The polypectomy site is sampled in block 1C and shows reactive and reparative changes without evidence of residual dysplastic polyp or evidence of adenocarcinoma. A second polyp, 5.1 cm distal to the original polyp, is an adenomatous polyp without evidence of high-grade dysplasia or malignancy. Further followup is suggested as clinically indicated.\n\n\n"
