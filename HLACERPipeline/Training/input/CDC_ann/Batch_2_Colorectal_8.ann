The specimen is received fresh, labeled desmoid desmoplastic reaction versus sigmoid colon cancer invading posterior peritoneum\". Received is a segment of white-tan, firm soft tissue measuring 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm in greatest dimensions. Representative section is submitted in cassette A1FS for frozen section and permanent diagnosis. (CAA; 5/30/2017) B. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled \"Routhsigmoid resection, en bloc distal ileum resection\" is a segment of sigmoid colon with an adherent segment of ileum, which is attached at the mesentery. The colon measures 18.4 cm in length by 11.2 cm in greatest circumference. The serosa is tan-pink, smooth and displays a 1.0 cm long, circumferential, indurated stricture located 6.0 cm from the closest resection margin. The mesentery runs the entire length of the specimen and measures up to 3.7 cm. The attached ileum measures 19.2 cm in length by 6.5 cm in circumference. The serosa is tan-pink and displays a 2.7 cm focal adhesion located 6.5 cm from the closest resection margin. The mesentery runs the entire length of the ileum and measures up to 6.2 cm in thickness. There is a 6.5 x 4.2 cm portion of mesentery which is adherent to the colonic serosa. The ileum and colon are opened longitudinally along the antimesenteric serosa to reveal a tan-pink mucosa with undulating folds and a 5.7 x 3.2 x 1.2 cm tan-pink lobular lesion within the central portion of the colon segment. The lesion is 6.1 cm from the closest colonic resection margin, is free of the opposite resection margin, 3.2 cm from the mesenteric margin and does not involve the ileum mucosa. Sectioning through the specimen reveals the lesion invades into the muscularis propria, through the circumferential radial margin and into the mesentery of the ileum. There are 17 possible lymph nodes are identified in the mesentery ranging in size from 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 up to 1.3 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm. Section code: B1-colon resection margin closest to lesion, B2-opposite resection margin, B3-mesenteric margin, B4-inked serosa adjacent to lesion, B5-represents section of lesion and adjacent mesentery, B6-represents section of lesion and adjacent normal mucosa, B7-representative section of colonic mesentery and small bowel mesentery (inked black), B8-6 possible lymph nodes, B9-6 possible lymph nodes, B10-5 possible lymph nodes, B11 through B12-opposite resection margins of ileum, B13-represents section of ileum with adhesions.\n\n\n"
