Tumor cells are strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 and negative for cytokeratin 20. Tumor cells show strong nuclear positivity for TTF-1. No neuroendocrine marking is identified on synaptophysin or CD56 stains. P63 stain is negative and Ki-67 proliferative index is in the range of 20%. Overall, the immunophenotype is consistent with primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Basic lung molecular panel will be performed and subsequently reported. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed an atypical abnormal signal pattern in 18% of the cells, which is consistent with an ALK (2p23) gene rearrangement. Rearrangement of the ALK gene most often corresponds to the t(2;5)(p23;q35) and its variants. It is a recurring abnormality in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and recent data demonstrate that the ALK gene is also rearranged in approximately 5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients who are positive for ALK rearrangement (greater than or equal to 15% of cells with the rearrangement) have been shown in clinical trials to respond positively to the FDA approved crizotinib. Of note, all of the ALK positive cells showed an atypical gene rearrangement with loss of the 5`ALK and additional copies of ALK.    FISH analysis revealed no break-apart signal pattern specific for ROS1 (6q22.1) gene rearrangement. However, 1-8 additional copies of ROS1 were observed in 80% of the cells. According to a study by Jin, Y et al. (see references below) ROS1 gene copy number gain (CNG) was found in 4.8 % of cases. ROS1 gene CNG was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS, 12 vs. 58 months; p=0.003) and shorter overall survival (OS, 40 vs. 67 months; p <0.001) than the group without CNG. Additional copies of ROS1 gene is an independent poor prognostic factor.    Monitoring for these abnormalities may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.    It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with other clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.    FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  ALK Breakapart (5`ALK; 3`ALK) - FDA Approved (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  ROS1 Breakapart (5`ROS1; 3`ROS1) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)    References:  Nat Med. 2012 Feb 12;18(3):382-4; Oncol Rep. 2012 Oct;28(4):1187-92; J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1667-74.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: portions of exons 18-21, consisting of codons 699-726, 729-840, 848-869 (specifically including codons E709, G719, S768, T790, L833, L858, L861 and deletions and insertions in exons 19 and 20). <BR/><BR/>Paez, J.
