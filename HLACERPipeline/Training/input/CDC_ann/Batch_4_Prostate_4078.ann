Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"prostate and pelvic lymph nodes\" is a radical prostatectomy specimen including attached seminal vesicles and vas deferens. Included in the container is a separate 5 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm aggregate of fatty tissue. Weight: 43 g. Size: 4.2 cm superior to inferior x 4 cm right to left x up to 4 cm anterior to posterior. Right seminal vesicle, Attached: 1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm. Left seminal vesicle, Attached: 1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm. Right vas deferens, Attached: 2.2 x 0.8 x 0.7 cm. Left vas deferens, Attached: 1.6 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm. Prostatic surface: Tan to red-brown, extensively cauterized around the bladder base. Inking code: Right half green, left half blue, anterior midline orange, posterior midline black. Sectioning: Apex and bladder base shaved off to be submitted. Remaining gland sectioned into 7 slices, numbered 1-7 sequentially from apex to base. Cut surface: The cut surface is yellow-tan. Within the inferior aspect of the right mid lobe is a 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm area of off-white discoloration which is in close proximity to the capsule and may represent tumor. Bisected from the previously described accompanying fatty tissue are 7 yellow-tan, mostly fat-replaced candidate nodes, 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 to 4 x 1.2 x up to 0.8 cm.

Tumor is bilateral occupying 65% of the gland.   The seminal vesicles are negative.   Extraprostatic extension present, bilateral, midgland to base predominantly on    the right   Perineural invasion is present.   No lymphovascular invasion is seen.   All margins of resection are negative.   Remaining gland demonstrates high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.   Seven lymph nodes free of metastasis (0/7).   Stage: pT3a pN0.
