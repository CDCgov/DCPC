Lung (right lower lobe), biopsy:\n  - Adenocarcinoma (see Comment and Synoptic data)\n  - POSITIVE for EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation.\n  - NEGATIVE for T790M mutation. (See Comment and Molecular Diagnostic report) \n\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nLung: right lower lobe lung biopsy\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nThe patient is noted to have metastatic lung adenocarcinoma to the brain (S14-82210) that was reported to be POSITIVE for EGFR exon 19 deletion and NEGATIVE for ALK by immunohistochemistry. Sections of the current biopsy demonstrate multiple fragments of lung core infiltrated by adenocarcinoma showing acinar and lepidic growth patterns. The cytomorphology is comparable to that of the brain resection. \n\nEGFR testing on current biopsy identifies the exon 19 deletion but NOT the T790M resistant mutation. \n\nMolecular Number:         M16.5509\nTest Method(s) Used:        EGFR-RT52\nEGFR Result:            Positive\nMutation Detected:         Exon 19 Deletion\n\nDNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded lung: right lower lobe biopsy, and analyzed using the EGFR-RT52 kit from EntroGen. This kit is based on a real-time PCR qualitative genotyping assay that uses fluorescently labeled probes for detection of 30 recurrent mutations in exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the EGFR gene, including exon 20 resistance mutations (T790M, S768I, and insertions). Details of the mutations tested are available upon request. \n\nThe lower limit of mutation detection using this assay is 2.5-5%. Minimum tumor cellularity for analysis is 5%. \n\nThis analysis is based on current knowledge of the most common EGFR mutations and their presence in adenocarcinoma of the lung. Somatic mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain are present in 10-40% of non-small cell lung cancers. The presence of these mutations will predict clinical response or resistance to EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva). Rarely, T790M occurs in untreated patients and may be present as an underlying germline mutation; this test will not discriminate germline T790M mutations from testing of tumor alone. This test will not identify rare mutations, such as E709K and D770_N771ins and is not appropriate for squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. Only adenocarcinomas of the lung or lung cancers with an adenocarcinoma component should be sent for testing. \n\nThe performance characteristics of this test were determined and verified by the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at the HOSPITAL. It has not been cleared or approved by the US FDA. FDA does not require this test to go through premarket FDA review. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.\n\nPan Q, et al.
