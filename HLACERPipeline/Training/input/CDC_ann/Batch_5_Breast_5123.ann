The tumor cells have enlarged, pleomorphic nuclei with\nprominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical stains show that tumor cells are\npositive for CK7 and E-cadherin, and are negative for ER and TTF1. The findings\nare consistent with a poorly differentiated invasive carcinoma. This could be\nconsistent with breast primary. However, other primary sites need to be ruled\nout.
