The specimen cannot grossly be oriented as to proximal and distal. The serosal surfaces are smooth, tan and glistening. Located 5.0 cm from one margin is a 2.5 x 1.3 cm transmural defect with surrounding red-brown hemorrhagic-appearing discoloration. The surfaces of this area are inked blue. The specimen is received partially opened. Completely opening the specimen reveals tan mucosa with irregular transverse folds. Corresponding to the transmural defect site is a white-tan to red rough irregular partially ulcerated mass measuring 4.8 x 4.5 cm. The mass measures 4.0 cm from the closest margin and 12.0 cm from the opposite margin. Serially sectioning through the mass reveals it to measure up to 2.5 cm deep, focally extending to the surface at the previously described transmural defect site. The mass measures 2.0 cm from the closest portion of the mesenteric margin. Located 9.5 cm from the large mass is a separate smaller tan exophytic lesion measuring 2.9 x 2.0 cm. This lesion is located 3.5 cm from the closest lesion. The mucosa between the mass and smaller lesion is unremarkable with no additional suspicious tissue. Serially sectioning through the smaller lesion reveals it to measure up to 0.5 cm deep, extending into the muscularis propria with a small area of possible extension into the underlying fat. The lesion does not approach the free serosal surfaces and it measures 3.5 cm from the closest portion of the mesenteric margin. No additional suspicious areas are identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A, the margin closest to the large mass, shaved off and entirely submitted; 1B, the margin closest to the smaller lesion, shaved off and entirely submitted; 1C-1G, the larger mass with each section full-thickness and the surface inked blue, including the apparent area of surface involvement; 1H, the closest portion of the mesenteric margin to the large mass; 1I, grossly uninvolved colon wall between the large mass and smaller lesion; 1J-1L, full- thickness sections of the smaller lesion at the deepest area of invasion, including the serosal surface inked blue; 1M, the portion of the mesenteric margin closest to the smaller lesion. Serially sectioning and palpating the attached mesenteric fat reveals multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. The possible lymph nodes are each entirely submitted as follows: 1N, 1 possible lymph node, trisected; 1O, 1 possible lymph node, serially sectioned; 1P, 2 possible lymph nodes, each bisected and inked for differentiation; 1Q-1R, 3 possible lymph nodes per cassette, each bisected and inked for differentiation; 1S, 4 possible lymph nodes, each intact; 1T, the remaining 2 possible lymph nodes, each intact.
