Specimen 1 labeled \"sigmoid colon\" consists of a segmental resection of large bowel which measures a total of 9.5 cm. It is previously opened and right in the center, there is a 2.7 x 2.4 cm exophytic polypoid neoplasm which is retracted and possibility ulcerated right in the center. This is 5 cm from 1 margin and 3.5 cm from the other. The serosa representing the radial margin is inked green. Multiple sections through the neoplasm to include the serosal surface, 1A, B and C. There is mesenteric fat which is amputated and nearly totally submitted in 1D. 2. Specimen 2 labeled \"proximal sigmoid colon\" consists of a segmental resection of large bowel 6 cm. It is intact. Proximal and distal surgical margins in 2A, grossly benign and viable. Upon opening, there is no mucosal defect. The full-thickness cross sections in 2B. The minimal amount of mesenteric fat completely sampled in 2C. Perioperative consultation with Dr. performed.\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - Left colon villous adenoma\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\n1. Sigmoid colon; segmental resection (9.5 cm):     Intraepithelial adenocarcinoma, 2 minority foci arising in dysplastic villous       adenoma (2.7 cm).     Negative for invasive malignancy.     Proximal, distal and radial surgical margins all benign and viable.     Initial pericolonic lymph node dissection: Negative for malignancy.     Initial TNM classification: pTis. 2. Proximal sigmoid colon (6 cm); segmental resection:     Segment of colon (6 cm) negative for specific pathologic change.     Pericolonic lymph node dissection after Carnoy's fixation: In process.\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nAddendum Report: After Carnoy's fixation, the sparse pericolonic lymph node and pericolonic fat are dissected in specimen 1 in cassettes 1E and 1F. Additional pericolonic fat without nodularity in 1G. After Carnoy's fixation, pericolonic lymph node dissection of specimen 2 representing a minimal amount of pericolonic fat, all in 2D. No focal nodularity or defect identified. SUPPLEMENTAL GROSS After evaluation of the pericolonic lymph node dissection, further pericolonic lymph node dissection after Carnoy's fixation of both specimens #1 and 2 are performed in blocks 1H and 1I for the first specimen and block 2E for the second specimen. These supplemental gross dissections represent the totality of the pericolonic fat in these 2 specimens. (ml3) SUPPLEMENTAL DIAGNOSIS 1. Sigmoid colon; segmental resection (9.5 cm):     Intraepithelial adenocarcinoma, 2 minority foci arising in dysplastic villous       adenoma (2.7 cm).     Negative for invasive malignancy.     Proximal, distal and radial surgical margins all benign and viable.     Initial pericolonic lymph node dissection: Negative for malignancy.     Initial TNM classification: pTis.     Pericolonic lymph node dissection: Seven pericolonic lymph nodes negative for       malignancy.     Final TNM classification: pTis pN0. 2. Proximal sigmoid colon (6 cm); segmental resection:     Segment of colon (6 cm) negative for specific pathologic change.     Pericolonic lymph node dissection after Carnoy's fixation: In process.     Pericolonic lymph node dissection after Carnoy's fixation: No lymphoid tissue       identified, entire pericolonic mesenteric fat submitted for microscopic       evaluation. SUPPLEMENTAL MICROSCOPIC Essentially all of the pericolonic mesenteric adipose tissue is dissected after Carnoy's fixation of specimen 1. Only 7 lymph nodes are identified and these are all negative for metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, the final TNM classification is pTis pN0. Specimen 2, similarly, is dissected after Carnoy's fixation and all of the pericolonic mesenteric fat is submitted for microscopic examination and there are no lymph nodes identified. (eam) ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.microscopic examination\n\nThe segmental resection of colon, 9.5 cm, confirms the presence of a villous adenoma. It is 2.7 cm largest diameter and, for the vast majority of this villous adenoma, shows delicate exophytic fronds with central fibrovascular cores covered by stratified columnar epithelium with scattered superbasilar mitotic figures, moderate epithelial atypia consistent with moderate epithelial dysplasia. A minority of areas show severe dysplasia and in very limited focal areas, less than 2 or 3% of the volume of this neoplasm, there is intraepithelial adenocarcinoma which consists of a marked stratification of columnar epithelial cells with marked decreased cytoplasmic mucinous differentiation, enlarged irregular nuclei with loss of nuclear polarity, increased mitotic figures as well as abnormal mitotic figures. However, there is no suggestion or evidence of invasive malignancy. Proximal and distal and radial surgical margins are all benign, the radial margin negative by minimum 1.5 cm. The pericolonic lymph node dissection is in process after Carnoy's fixation to complete the evaluation and reporting. Initial TNM classification is pTis. The proximal sigmoid colon, 6 cm shows benign proximal and distal surgical margins and there is no specific pathologic change. Pericolonic lymph node dissection in process and the final report will be issued.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\n1. Sigmoid colon 2. Proximal sigmoid colon\n\n\n"
