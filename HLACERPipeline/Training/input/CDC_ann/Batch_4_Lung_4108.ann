The tumor cells are arranged in sheets and have hyperchromatic, pleomorphic nuclei. There is a small to moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm present with a focal suggestion of cytoplasmic keratinization. Immunohistochemical stains with appropriate controls are performed. The tumor cells appear positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and demonstrate nuclear staining for p63. The tumor cells appear negative for monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (mCEA) and lack nuclear staining for thyroid transcription factor (TTF-1). The morphologic findings demonstrate a poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma with the immunohistochemical staining pattern most consistent with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. A glandular component, however, cannot be completely excluded. The specimen will be submitted for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and PD-L1 testing with separate reports to follow. The case has been reviewed by Dr. Rebecca who concurs with the diagnosis. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed no break-apart signal pattern specific for ROS1 (6q22.1) gene rearrangement. However, a deletion of ROS1 was detected in 27% of cells analyzed. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.   Monitoring for this anomaly may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.   FISH analysis revealed no ALK (2p23) gene rearrangement. However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with other clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  ALK Breakapart (5`ALK; 3`ALK) - FDA Approved (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  ROS1 Breakapart (5`ROS1; 3`ROS1) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)   References:  J Mol Diagn. 2013 Apr 4. doi:pii: S1525-1578(13)00041-X.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.
