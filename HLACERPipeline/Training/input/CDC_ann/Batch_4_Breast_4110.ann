Received in formalin labeled \", right breast tissue\" is a 918 g, 14.5 x 13.4 x 8.0 cm mastectomy specimen. Orienting sutures are identified which per the requisition are designated as \"single long cranial, and double short medial.\" The specimen is partially surfaced by a 19.0 x 8.6 cm ellipse of skin. The skin surface is tan-white, wrinkled, displays a 2.2 x 2.0 cm nipple as well as a 7.5 x 6.3 cm area of red-brown to tan-yellow area of firm ulcerative tissue. This area of ulceration is located in the lower inner quadrant. The posterior margin is inked in black, the superior margin is inked in blue, and the inferior margin is inked in green. Serial sectioning reveals a 7.7 x 6.5 x 5.4 cm well defined, smooth pink, focally hemorrhagic mass located predominantly in the lower inner quadrant. The mass comes to within 2.0 cm of the deep margin, and grossly abuts both the superior and inferior margins. Approximately 2.4 cm lateral to the 1st described lesion is a 2nd, 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm ill defined firm rubbery nodule located in the upper outer quadrant. This nodule is 4.0 cm from the superior margin, 4.5 cm from the deep margin, and 5.5 cm from the inferior margin. 5.0 cm inferior to the 2nd described nodule is a 3rd, 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm tan-pink, rubbery circumscribed nodule. This nodule is located at the deep margin, 1.5 cm from the inferior margin, and 10.0 cm from the superior margin. A 4th, 1.3 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm well defined, gray-white, firm nodule is located in the upper outer quadrant, approximately 4.0 cm superior of the 2nd described nodule. This 4th nodule comes to within 1.3 cm of the superior margin, 8.2 cm from the deep margin, and 9.5 cm from the inferior margin. The remaining cut surfaces appear tan-yellow, lobular and interspersed with a scant amount of gray-white fibrous tissue. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A nipple, 3/1, 1B skin with lesion, 1/1, 1C 1st described lesion in relation to inferior margin, 1/1, 1D 1st described lesion in relation to superior margin, 1/1, 1E-1F central sections of 1st described lesion, 1/1 each, 1G entire 2nd described nodule, 1/1, 1H-1I entire 3rd described nodule, H 1/1, I, 2/1, 1J-1K representative sections of 4th described nodule to include areas closest to margin, 1/1 each, 1L upper outer quadrant, 1/1, 1M lower outer quadrant, 1/1, 1N lower inner quadrant, 1/1, 1O upper inner quadrant, 2/1. Additional sections are submitted as follows: 1P-1R, mass including grossly involved superior margin; 1S-1T, mass including grossly involved inferior margin. (KSA/AAC/cc6) 2. Received in formalin labeled \", right breast tissue medial\" is a 34 g, 9.5 x 4.5 x 2.2 cm unoriented fragment of yellow-tan lobulated and fibroadipose tissue. One aspect of the fragment appears cauterized consistent with the old margin. The opposite surface appears smooth with a concave shape. This aspect is inked in black. Serial sectioning reveals yellow-tan lobulated, glistening, unremarkable cut surfaces. No lesions or masses are identified grossly. Also received in the container is a 9.1 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm fragment of skin. The skin surface is tan-white, wrinkled and grossly unremarkable. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes 2A-2F. A-E, 1/1 each, F, 3/1. 3. Received in formalin labeled \", right breast inferior flap\" is a 10.8 x 3.9 cm ellipse of skin excised to a depth of 2.5 cm. The skin surface is tan- white, wrinkled and displays a 1.1 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm palpably firm nodule located 0.5 cm from the nearest edge. The deep margin is inked in black. Sectioning reveals tan- yellow, lobulated glistening cut surfaces. Sectioning the palpable nodule reveals a circumscribed tan-yellow to tan-pink firm lesion. Representative sections to include the entire nodule are submitted in cassettes 3A-3E, 1/1 each. 4. Received in formalin labeled \", matted axillary node\" are multiple irregular tan-pink, firm fragments of soft tissue ranging from 0.7 to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension, and measuring 3.0 x 2.5 x 0.8 cm in aggregate. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes 4A-4C, 4/1 each. (JOK)\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - Right breast abscess\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\n1. Breast, right, mastectomy:     Invasive mammary carcinoma, no special type (ductal), high combined       histologic grade, high proliferative rate, measuring approximately 77 mm in       greatest extent, with skin ulceration, present at superior and inferior margins.     Multiple satellite foci of invasive mammary carcinoma, measuring up to 12 mm in       greatest extent.     One intramammary lymph node, negative for malignancy (0/1).     See comments. 2. Breast, right medial, excision:     Focal invasive mammary carcinoma, measuring up to 2 mm in greatest extent,       new surgical margins negative for tumor.     Benign skin. 3. Breast, right inferior, excision:     Dermal involvement by invasive mammary carcinoma, measuring 1.1 cm in       greatest extent, all surgical margins negative for tumor, no evidence of dermal       lymphatic space invasion. 4. Lymph node, axillary, excision:     Multiple fragments of lymph node extensively involved by metastatic mammary       carcinoma, largest contiguous fragment measuring at least 11 mm.     Two separate lymph nodes, negative for malignancy.
