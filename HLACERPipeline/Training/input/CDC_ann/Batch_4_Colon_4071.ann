COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components).  These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome.  Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS).  If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing.  [References available on request].   ## End of auxiliary report ## Ancillary Report: Immunoperoxidase staining was performed and evaluated with appropriate controls. Tumor cells are positive for CDX2.  CDX2 expression has important prognostic value in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Loss of CDX2 expression is associated with an aggressive clinical course including infiltrative growth, and advanced T, N, M and overall stage.

This result is consistent with a competent mismatch repair function.  Cancers  with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS).<BR/><BR/>Microsatellite  Instability Analysis has multifaceted clinical utility: as a predictive  biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response; as a prognostic and  predictive biomarker for colorectal carcinoma; and as a genetic risk biomarker  for the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as Lynch  Syndrome.<BR/><BR/>As an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy biomarker, recent  literature (Le, et al., <i>N Engl J Med</i> 372:2509-2520; Topolian, et al.,  <i>Nature Reviews Cancer</i> 16:275-287) indicates that, in general, patients  that are Microsatellite Stable (MSS) have a poorer response to immune  checkpoint inhibitor therapy.<BR/><BR/>MSS tumors have poorer prognosis than  MSI-H tumors, and better response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant  chemotherapy. <BR/><BR/>As a genetic risk biomarker, the result of MSS is  inconsistent with Lynch syndrome. However, if the clinical suspicion remains  high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as  attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result,  consideration should be given to a genetic consult to direct additional  testing. <BR/><BR/>Interpretation of this result of MSS in the context of other  clinical and laboratory findings is strongly recommended.

SmartGenomics colon profile is pending, results to be reported separately. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed no evidence of MET (7q31.2) gene amplification. The MET/CEP7 ratio was 1.01. However, 1-2 additional copies of MET and CEP7 (centromere 7) were detected in 41% of cells analyzed, indicating polysomy of chromosome 7. Gain of MET and/or chromosome 7 is an independent prognostic factor associated with a poor prognosis in many neoplasms, including colorectal cancer.   FISH revealed no evidence of HER2 (17q12) gene amplification. The HER2/CEP17 ratio was 1.37. However, 1-3 additional copies of HER2 and CEP17 (centromere 17) were detected in 34% of cells analyzed, indicating polysomy of chromosome 17. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.    Monitoring for these anomalies may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.   It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with classic cytogenetics, clinical, flow cytometric, and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  CEP7/MET (Centromere 7/7q31) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  CEP17/HER2 (Centromere 17/17q12) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)   References:  Nat Med. 2012 Feb 12;18(3):382-4; Oncol Rep. 2012 Oct;28(4):1187-92; J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1667-74; J Thorac Oncol. 2010 Mar;5(3):305-13; J Clin Oncol. 2012, 30(35):4352-9; Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book. 2014;34:e353-65; Cancers (Basel). 2015 May 26;7(2):930-49; Tumour Biol. 2015 Dec;36(12):9813-21. Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist and representative areas of tumor and normal tissue selected. These areas were microdissected from the surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA extracted using standard methods (QIAGEN QIASymphony). The tumor and normal DNA were separately PCR amplified for five microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27; Promega Corp.), and size fractionated via capillary electrophoresis (Life Technologies 3500xl). The tumor and normal profiles were compared to determine the presence of altered microsatellite profiles. The analytic sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10-20% and is dependent on the size and clonality of any instability. The presence of instability in less than 10-20% of the DNA examined will not be detected. This assay uses reagents that may be marked as Research Use Only or Analyte Specific Reagent. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. Portions of this test use reagents designated by the manufacturer as for research use, not for clinical use. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.
