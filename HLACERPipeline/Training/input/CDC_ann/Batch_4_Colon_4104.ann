The terminal ileum, 9.3 cm in length has an average circumference of 7.0 cm. The mucosa is red-pink with focal areas displaying slight hemorrhage. No polyps or lesions are grossly identified. The cecum and right colon, 23.5 cm has a varying circumference ranging up to 16.5 cm near the ileocecal valve down to 12.0 cm near the distal margin. The attached appendix, 8.2 cm in length has an average diameter of 1.1 cm. Found within the right colon is an area that is strictured containing a pink-tan circumferential lesion, 6.5 x 3.6 cm. This lesion is 16.5 cm from the proximal margin, 11.2 cm from the distal margin, and 6.3 cm from the resected radial margin. Upon sectioning, the lesion ranges up to 1.2 cm in thickness with focal areas of gross invasion into the underlying fatty tissue. The remainder of the cecum and right colon display pink-red mucosa with normal folds. The wall averages 0.3 cm in thickness. No secondary polyps or lesions are grossly identified. The appendix serosa is tan-brown, covered in congested blood vessels and displays focal adhesions along the proximal segment. The wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The lumen is dilated and contains soft, gray-brown fecal material. No perforations or other abnormalities are grossly identified. Sectioning of the surrounding fatty tissue reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 cm up to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. The separately submitted portion of small bowel measures 8.0 cm in length and has an average circumference of 6.6 cm. The serosa and subserosal adipose tissue is grossly unremarkable. Upon opening, the mucosa is red-pink and displays folds arranged in the usual manner. The wall averages 0.2 to 0.3 cm in thickness. No polyps or lesions are grossly identified. Summary of sections: 1A, margins from right colon, 2/1; 1B, lesion with underlying fatty tissue, 1/1; 1C-G, additional sections of lesion with adjacent normal mucosa, 1/1 each; 1H, nearest resected radial margin, 1/1; 1I, cross sections of appendix and bisected section of tip, 3/1; 1J, margins from smallest segment of bowel, 2/1; 1K, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1L, 4 lymph nodes, 4/1; 1M, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1N, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1O, 1 bisected lymph node, 2/1; 1P, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1Q, 1 bisected lymph node, 2/1.
