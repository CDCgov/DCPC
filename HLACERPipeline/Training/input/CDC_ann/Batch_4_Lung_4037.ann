While the MET/CEP7 ratio was 1.37, 66% of cells had 6 or more copies of MET with an average copy number of 8.89. Amplification of MET is associated with poor prognosis in a variety of neoplasms. Amplification of MET also plays a role in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors of patients with EGFR-mutant tumors. Limited studies suggest that MET-amplified tumors may respond to crizotinib, an inhibitor of MET and ALK.    FISH analysis detected a HER2 (17q12) gene amplification. The ratio of HER2 to CEP17 was 2.20. Amplification of HER2 is associated with poor prognosis in a variety of neoplasms. Tumors harboring amplification of HER2 may be responsive to HER2 inhibitors (ie., trastuzumab, lapatinib).    FISH analysis detected no evidence of an ALK (2p23) gene rearrangement. However, 6-14 additional copies of ALK were observed in 42% of the cells, consistent with amplification of the 2p23 chromosome region. Amplification of ALK has been suggested in some studies to be associated with a better clinical outcome in patients treated with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as crizotinib.    FISH analysis revealed no evidence of a RET (10q11.21) gene rearrangement. However, 4-18 additional copies of RET were detected in 40% of cells analyzed, consistent with amplification of RET. Amplification of RET may be responsive to multi-targeted kinase inhibitors. A number of multi-targeted kinase inhibitors are commercially available that have RET activity such as sorafenib and sunitinib, but the efficacy of these in RET gene amplification lung cancer is not completely established.    FISH analysis revealed no break-apart signal pattern specific for ROS1 (6q22.1) gene rearrangement. However, 1-13 additional copies of ROS1 were observed in 78% of the cells. According to a study by Jin, Y et al. (see references below) ROS1 gene copy number gain (CNG) was found in 4.8 % of cases. ROS1 gene CNG was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS, 12 vs. 58 months; p=0.003) and shorter overall survival (OS, 40 vs. 67 months; p <0.001) than the group without CNG. Additional copies of ROS1 gene is an independent poor prognostic factor. Overall, these results are indicative of a complex abnormal karyotype (3 or more abnormalities) likely predicting for a rapid disease progression and a poor treatment outcome.    Monitoring for these abnormalities may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.    It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with classic cytogenetics, clinical, flow cytometric, and morphological data is recommended, if available.    FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  ALK Breakapart (5`ALK; 3`ALK) - FDA Approved (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  ROS1 Breakapart (5`ROS1; 3`ROS1) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  RET Breakapart (5`RET; 3`RET) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  CEP7/MET (Centromere 7/7q31) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  CEP17/HER2 (Centromere 17/17q12) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)      References:  Nat Med. 2012 Feb 12;18(3):382-4; Oncol Rep. 2012 Oct;28(4):1187-92; J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1667-74.
