We have performed immunohistochemical stains with appropriate control and tumor cells demonstrate positive immunoreactivity with cytokeratin, CK 7, GATA 3, ER (90% of tumor cells; strong) and PR (90% of tumor cells; strong) consistent with breast primary. This carcinoma cells admixed with lymphoid cell population may represent metastasis to lymph node (although no lymph node capsule seen) or dense lymphoid response to tumor in the breast. Clinical and pathological correlations are required. The grade of tumor is not defined in current biopsy as this may represent a metastasis.\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\nA.

HANNA, HOSPITAL 2 (S16-9474), REPORTED 25/04/16\nDiagnosis\nBreast, right, axillary tail: Invasive carcinoma, please see comment.\nComment\nSections from these core biopsies show dense lymphoid tissue surrounding multiple variable size nests of cohesive tumor cells with focal tubule formation. The tumor is moderately differentiated. There is strong diffuse staining of the tumor cells for Gata3, low molecular weight keratin and cytokeratin 7 as well as estrogen and progesterone receptors. This profile is consistent with a breast carcinoma.\nIn these 3 cores from the axillary tail one core show a rim of dense fibrous tissue suggestive of part of a fibrous capsule of the node. However it is possible that this is either an invasive carcinoma with prominent lymphoid stroma or that the tumor is in the axillary tail with direct extension to an axillary node. Clinical correlation is warranted.\nThe details of the biomarkers will be reported separately.\nBIOMARKERS REPORT (B16-1020)\nDiagnosis:\nBreast, right, axillary tail: Please see synoptic report.\nSpecimen\nSpecimen Type:\t\tOther: Core from axillary tail\nTumour 1\nBlock #:\t\tA1\nTumour type:\t\tOther: invasive carcinoma\nER\nER Results:\t\tPOSITIVE\n% Positive:\t\t100%\nAverage Intensity:\tStrong\nPgR\nPgR Results:\t\tPOSITIVE\n% Positive:\t\t100%\nAverage Intensity:\tStrong\nHER2 by IHC:\nHER2 IHC Results:\tNEGATIVE (SCORE 0)\t\nMethods\nCold ischemia and fixation times meet the requirements specified in the latest version of the ASCO / CAP Guidelines: Yes\nFixative:\t\t\tFormalin\nPrimary Antibody - ER: \tSP1 (Health Canada approved)\nPrimary Antibody - PgR:\t1E2 (Health Canada approved)\nPrimary Antibody - Her2:\t4B5 (Health Canada approved)\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nSPECIMEN:\n A.
