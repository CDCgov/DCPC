Loss of DNA mismatch repair enzyme MLH-1 with secondary loss of PMS-2.   2. Additional testing for BRAF mutation analysis is PENDING (results will be reported separately).   3. See comment.  COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue, controls react appropriately) per EGAPP recommendations reveals loss of nuclear expression of DNA mismatch repair enzyme MLH-1 with secondary loss of PMS-2, and intact staining for mismatch repair enzymes MSH-2 and MSH-6. These results indicate DEFECTIVE DNA MISMATCH REPAIR (MMR) ENZYME FUNCTION within this tumor. Hereditary-associated, as well as sporadic, colorectal carcinomas (CRC) that have defective mismatch repair have been shown to have distinct survival outcome and treatment-associated characteristics (patients with defective MMR function do not benefit from fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy). In order to determine whether this reflects a germ line loss of MLH-1 due to Lynch syndrome, or acquired hypermethylation-related loss of MLH-1, BRAF mutation analysis is required and is in process. The results of the BRAF mutation analysis will be reported separately, and a comprehensive final report addressing all testing methods will be issued when those results are available. Please contact the signout pathologist if you have any questions in the interim. ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.microscopic examination\n\nMultiple biopsies of mass, distal sigmoid colon confirm the clinical suspicion of malignancy. This is an infiltrating and ulcerated adenocarcinoma which for the most part forms a low grade cribriform pattern, grade 2. However, a minority component in these biopsies is mucinous differentiation in which lakes of pale basophilic mucinous material dissect between the fibrocollagenous connective tissue and are associated with a few adenocarcinoma cells floating within. Immunohistochemistry for microsatellite instability is in process and will be reported separately. Call to Dr. 09/12/2017.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nBiopsy distal sigmoid cancer\n\n\n"
