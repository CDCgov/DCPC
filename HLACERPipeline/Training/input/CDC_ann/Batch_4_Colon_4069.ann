Medicare contractors require utilizing Amsterdam or revised Bethesda criteria and IHC as a first step in screening for Lynch Syndrome in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC). NCCN guidelines recommends all patients with newly diagnosed CRC to be offered Lynch Syndrome testing, including MSI and/or MMR-IHC. MSI and/or MMR-IHC are also useful in providing prognostic and therapeutic response information, such as 5-FU therapy, in CRC. A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated MSI to be associated with response to certain immune checkpoint inhibitors. NCCN guidelines also recommend genomic profiling in certain colorectal tumors for prognostic and/or therapeutic decision making. Mutations in certain genes such as KRAS and NRAS predict for lack of response to monoclonal anti-EGFR targeted therapies. Two recent studies have associated aspirin use to be associated with improved survival in patients with colorectal tumors harboring mutations in the PIK3CA gene. BRAF mutations are associated with an aggressive clinical course and many promising clinical trials are enrolling patients based on the mutational status of this gene. Genomic aberrations in other genes including TP53, KRAS, CMET, PTEN, CTNNB1, and APC have also been associated with an aggressive clinical course. References will be furnished upon request. The revised Bethesda criteria include colon cancer diagnosed under the age of 50, presence of synchronous or metachronous CRC or other Lynch Syndrome associated tumor regardless of age, morphologic findings consistent with MSI-H histology in an individual who is less than 60, colon cancer diagnosed with one or more first degree relatives with a Lynch Syndrome related tumor, with one of the cancers diagnosed under the age of 50, or colon cancer in 2 or more first degree relatives with a lynch related tumor, regardless of age. Morphologic findings associated with MSI-H status include tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, signet ring cell features, mucinous histology, medullary growth pattern, neutrophilic infiltrate, poor differentiation, and/or syncytial growth pattern. It is important to note that revised Bethesda criteria can miss a significant percentage of patients who have an inherited predisposition to CRC. Genomic profiling for prognostic and therapeutic information is underway. If there is clinical or morphologic suspicion of Lynch Syndrome, please contact PathGroup customer service at 855-854-6473 to request additional Lynch Syndrome testing. ## End of auxiliary report ## Addendum Report: Results of mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry:    - DNA mismatch repair enzymes intact (normal protein expression).    - See comment. ## End of auxiliary report ## Ancillary Report: Immunoperoxidase staining was performed and evaluated with appropriate controls.

SmartGenomics colon profile is pending, results to be reported separately. Quality assurance review by Dr. with concurrence. 1,3. Endoscopic correlation is recommended; the histologic pattern in each specimen suggests the specimen designations may have been transposed. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed no evidence of MET (7q31.2) gene amplification. The MET/CEP7 ratio was 1.07. However, 1-2 additional copies of MET and CEP7 (centromere 7) were detected in 26% of cells analyzed, indicating polysomy of chromosome 7. Gain of MET and/or chromosome 7 is an independent prognostic factor associated with a poor prognosis in many neoplasms, including colorectal cancer.   Monitoring for this anomaly may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.   FISH revealed no evidence of HER2 (17q12) gene amplification. However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with classic cytogenetics, clinical, flow cytometric, and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed in interphase cells using the MET (7q31.2)/CEP7 (centromere 7) and CEP17 (centromere 17)/HER2 (17q12) dual color DNA amplification probes (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL).
