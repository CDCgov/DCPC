Received in the fresh state for intraoperative frozen section consultation undesignated \"Latz, left sentinel lymph node\", is a yellow-tan lymph node measuring 1.1 0.6 0.5 cm which is sectioned and entirely submitted for frozen section and subsequent permanent microscopy designated A1 FS. B.  The specimen is received in formalin, labeled \"Latz, left breast\", and consists of a skin saving mastectomy specimen weighing 257 g which is oriented as double long suture lateral and double short suture superior.  It measures 15.5 14 2.5 cm.  Attached on the anterior aspect is a ellipse of tan skin measuring 3.7 2.8 cm which has a centrally located elevated nonulcerated nipple measuring 1.1 cm in diameter.  The skin surface is discolored by blue marker and is without recent incisions are obvious scars. The deep margin is generally smooth and marked with black dye and the superior and inferior aspects of the specimen are blue and orange dye, respectively.  The breast is subdivided into 4 quadrants and step sectioned revealing a poorly defined indurated tan mass within the upper outer breast quadrant located near the junction of the upper outer and lower outer quadrants.  The mass measures about 2.2 2 1.5 cm and is located 0.2-0.3 cm from the superior margin and 0.4 and 0.5 cm from the deep margin.  Remainder of the mammary tissue away from the mass is composed largely of dense white fibrous mammary tissue with some scattered areas of lobulated adipose.  The breast was surgically excised at 13:23 hours and placed in formalin 13:57 hours on 06/29/17 and of the total estimated formalin fixation time of 31 hours.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: Nipple B1, 3 contiguous sections including greatest diameter of mass B2-B3, additional section of mass and adjacent margins B4 and mammary tissue away from mass from the upper outer, upper inner, lower inner and lower outer breast quadrants B5, B6, B7 and B8 respectively. C.  The specimen is received in formalin, labeled \"Latz, right breast\", and consists of a simple skin saving mastectomy specimen weighing 267 g and measuring 17.5 15 2.5 cm.  Attached to the anterior aspect is an ellipse of tan skin measuring 4.1 3.4 cm which has a centrally located elevated nonulcerated nipple measuring about 1.2 cm in diameter.  The skin surface is without recent incisions or obvious scars.  The deep margin is smooth and marked with black dye in the superior and inferior aspects of the specimen with blue and orange dye respectively.  Breast is subdivided into 4 quadrants and step sectioned revealing dense white fibrous appearing mammary tissue with scattered areas of lobulated adipose and a few cysts without discrete nodules or masses.  The breast was excised at 13:56 hours and placed in formalin 13:57 hours on 06/29/17 has a total estimated formalin fixation time of 31 hours. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Nipple C1 and mammary tissue from upper outer, lower outer, lower inner and upper inner breast quadrants C2, C3, C4 and C5 respectively .(CWM; 6/30/2017)||||||F|||20170807094839|26D0652233^LabCorp Overland Park^CLIA|||\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment procedure\n\nCPT                            .88307 88342 88331 88307 88307\n\n\nPATHOLOGIST NAME\n\nElectronically signed: Pathologist name, Pathologist\n\n\nDiagnosis ICD code\n\nPathologist provided ICD-10:C77.3 C50.912 N60.11\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nClinical history: Pre-op diagnosis: Left side breast cancer Postop diagnosis: Same Clinical history: None\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis:A.

Her2 FISH testing reflexively ordered; results pending. Electronically Signed by on 5/11/2017 at Midwest Anatomic Pathology Lab Jay Christopher Helsel MD Methodology The HER2 Receptor protein expression is analyzed using the Ventana HER2 rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone 4B5). This assay is used for diagnostic determination of the HER2 protein over-expression in paraffin embedded, formalin fixed breast cancer tissue on the Ventana Benchmark. The specimen is processed using a polymer detection system. The membrane staining of the tumor is determined either by manual score or image analysis. This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic use. The score is reported as per package insert; 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+. This test is used for clinical purposes. A rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone SP1) that recognized the Estrogen Receptor is used to perform immunohistochemistry on routinely fixed (formalin) paraffin embedded tissue on the Ventana Benchmark. The specimen is processed using a polymer detection system. The percentage of stained tumor nuclei is determined either manually or by image analysis. This test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use. This test is used for clinical purposes. A rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone 1E2) that recognized the Progesterone Receptor is used to perform immunohistochemistry on routinely fixed (formalin) paraffin embedded tissue on the Ventana Benchmark. The specimen is processed using a polymer detection system. The percentage of stained tumor nuclei is determined either manually or by image analysis. This test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use. This test is used for clinical purposes. A rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone 30-9) that recognized Ki67 is used to perform immunohistochemistry on routinely fixed (formalin) paraffin embedded tissue on the Ventana Benchmark. The specimen is processed using a polymer detection system. The percentage of stained tumor nuclei is determined either manually or by image analysis. This test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use. This test is used for clinical purposes. Intended Use (when used as Prognostic/Predictive Markers): This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use. Estrogen Receptor (ER) (SP1) is a rabbit monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is intended for the qualitative detection of estrogen receptor (ER) antigen in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. ER is a rabbit monoclonal antibody that recognizes human estrogen receptor alpha. This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use. Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) is a rabbit monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is intended for the qualitative detection of progesterone receptor (PR) antigen in sections of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue. PR is a rabbit monoclonal antibody that recognizes the A and B forms of the human progesterone receptor. This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use. HER2 (4B5) is a rabbit monoclonal antibody intended for the semi-quantitative detection of HER2 antigen in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded normal and neoplastic tissue. The HER2 protein is expressed as a level detectable by immunohistochemistry in up to 20 percent of adenocarcinomas from various sites. This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use. Ki-67 (30-9) is a rabbit monoclonal antibody (IgG) directed against C-terminal portion of Ki-67 antigen. Staining for Ki-67 can be used to aid in assessing the proliferative activity of normal and neoplastic tissue. Ki-67 is a nuclear protein expressed in proliferating cells. During the cell cycle, the Ki-67 antigen is present in the G1, S, G2 and M phase but is absent in the G0 (quiescent phase).

HER2 testing at Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc., is performed in compliance with the 2013 updated ASCO/CAP Clinical Practice Guidelines and Recommendations for HER2 testing in Breast Cancer. If the result is EQUIVOCAL (2+), it must be confirmed by an alternative assay such as FISH or Dual ISH. REF: Wolff AC, et al. Recommendations for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing in breast cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American pathologists Clinical Practice Guideline Update. J Clin Oncol. 2013 Nov 1;31(31):3997-4013. HER2 and ER/PR ASCO/CAP guidelines require fixation in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 72 hours. Fixation times less than 6 hours may not adequately preserve cell proteins. Fixation times longer than 72 hours may cause excess cross-linking of proteins reducing the antigen available for staining. Either scenario can cause reduced staining; hence false negative results are possible and should be considered for these situations if the HER2 IHC score is less than 3+ or ER or PR is negative (no staining or <1% positive). It is recommended that specimens fixed longer than 72 hours with HER2 IHC scores less than 3+ be confirmed by HER2 FISH or Dual ISH. The time from biopsy/excision to fixation in formalin (cold ischemic time) must be less than 1 hour. Time to fixation (cold ischemic time) greater than 1 hour should be interpreted with caution. HER2 testing, mainly HER2 by FISH, is particularly vulnerable since excessive cold ischemic time results in preferential loss of HER2 probe signals that may lead to false negative results. The immunohistochemistry tests performed at Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc. were validated on tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The performance characteristics of the tests performed on tissue processed in other fixatives is not known.
