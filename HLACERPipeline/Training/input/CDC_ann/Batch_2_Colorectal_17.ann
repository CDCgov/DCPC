Over 90% of the mutations are the V600E (1799T>A) mutation, but other V600 mutations have been reported. A negative result does not rule out the presence of other non-V600 mutations. Correlation with other clinical findings is needed for the most accurate interpretation. This test detects multiple V600 mutations in BRAF, including V600E, V600K and other V600 variants. See report APV17-001079 for further information. See Molecular report MKR17-001016 for further information. See report MNR17-000815 for further information. Analytical Results: Assay Type        Detection Parameters   Result BRAF Gene Mutation Exon 15   V600        Negative Electronically Signed by on 7/27/2017 at Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc. Perry Chan, Ph.D., MBA DABMG, DABCC, DLMcm, M(ASCP)cm, MB(ASCP)cm Methodology: Genomic DNA was isolated from the provided specimen. Exon 15 of the BRAF gene was subjected to PCR and SNaPShot multiplex primer extension for mutation detection. This assay is able to detect 5% mutation in a background of wild-type DNA. Intended Use: The detection of a BRAF V600 gene mutation aids in the specific diagnosis of certain cancers, such as hairy cell leukemia, and help to identify patients with worse prognosis and who may be responsive to certain therapies in a variety of cancers.

The specimen is received fresh, labeled \"Wackermanliver biopsy\" are 2 tan-pink irregular fragments of soft tissue measuring 1.2 x 0.9 x 0.2 cm in aggregate. A representative sample is submitted for frozen section and submitted in A1 FS for further processing. The remaining tissue is submitted in A2. B. Received in formalin labeled \"Wackermangallbladder\" is a 6.4 x 3.2 x 2.7 cm intact cholecystectomy specimen. The serosa is yellow-green, smooth and displays a focal area of cautery artifact. The specimen is opened to reveal dark green bile and a dark green velvety mucosa. Sectioning through the specimen reveals the wall ranges in thickness 0.4 up to 0.6 cm and the cystic duct is patent. No stones are grossly identified within the specimen or the container. Representative sections are submitted in B1. C. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled \"Wackermanperitoneal nodule\" is a gray-tan irregular membranous fragment of tissue measuring 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.2 cm. The tissue is entirely submitted in C1. D. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled \"Wackermansigmoid colon\" is an unoriented segment of colon measuring 24.1 cm in length by 6.5 cm in circumference. The serosa is tan-pink and displays a 1.1 x 1 cm puckered lesion on the central portion of the colon which is located 10.2 cm from the closest resection margin and free of the opposite margin. The mesentery runs the entire length of the specimen and measures up to 6.2 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal a tan-pink mucosa and a metallic wire stent adjacent to a 3.5 x 3.7 cm circumferential ulcerated lesion. The lesion is 10.2 cm from the closest resection margin is widely free of the opposite margin. There are metallic probes and a black tattoo adjacent to this lesion. Located 2.5 cm from the ulceration is a focal area of necrosis measuring 2.5 x 3.5 cm and is located 5.6 cm from the closest resection margin. Sectioning through the specimen reveals invasion through the muscularis and into the adjacent mesentery. The lesion approaches the mesenteric margin and is 0.3 cm from the radial margin adjacent to the serosa. The mesentery reveals 18 possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 up to 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm. Section code: D1 and D2-opposite resection margins, D3-mesenteric margin D4-representative section of lesion and adjacent mesentery, D5-representative section of lesion and adjacent serosa, D6-representative section of lesion and adjacent normal mucosa, D7-representative section of necrotic mucosa, D8-6 possible lymph nodes, D9-6 possible lymph nodes, D10-6 possible lymph nodes.
