However, 6-13 additional copies of ALK were observed in 32% of the cells, consistent with amplification of the 2p23 chromosome region. Amplification of ALK has been suggested in some studies to be associated with a better clinical outcome in patients treated with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as crizotinib.   FISH analysis detected a MET (7q31.2) gene amplification. While the MET/CEP7 ratio was 1.52, 29% of cells had 6 or more copies of MET with an average copy number of 7.14. Amplification of MET is associated with poor prognosis in a variety of neoplasms. Amplification of MET also plays a role in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors of patients with EGFR-mutant tumors. Limited studies suggest that MET-amplified tumors may respond to crizotinib, an inhibitor of MET and ALK.   FISH analysis revealed no break-apart signal pattern specific for ROS1 (6q22.1) gene rearrangement. However, 1-6 additional copies of ROS1 were observed in 82% of the cells. According to a study by Jin, Y et al. (see references below) ROS1 gene copy number gain (CNG) was found in 4.8 % of cases. ROS1 gene CNG was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS, 12 vs. 58 months; p=0.003) and shorter overall survival (OS, 40 vs. 67 months; p <0.001) than the group without CNG. Additional copies of ROS1 gene is an independent poor prognostic factor.   FISH analysis revealed no evidence of a RET (10q11.21) gene rearrangement. However, 1-8 additional copies of RET were detected in 62% of cells analyzed.   FISH revealed no evidence of HER2 (17q12) gene amplification. The HER2/CEP17 ratio was 1.50. However, 1-4 additional copies of HER2 and CEP17 (centromere 17) were detected in 59% of cells analyzed, indicating polysomy of chromosome 17.   Overall, these results are indicative of a complex abnormal karyotype (3 or more abnormalities) likely predicting for a rapid disease progression and a poor treatment outcome.   Monitoring for these abnormalities may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.   It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with classic cytogenetics, clinical, flow cytometric, and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed in interphase cells using the ALK (2p23; FDA-approved), ROS1 (6q22.1), and the RET (10q11.21) dual color, break apart rearrangement DNA probes and the MET (7q31.2)/CEP7(centromere 7) and CEP17(centromere 17)/HER2 (17q12) dual color DNA amplification probes (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL).
