Sectioning and palpation revealed 1 firm, tan-gray mass, 5.3 x 3.2 x 2.4 cm. Portions of the mass are examined as frozen section. The remainder of the specimen displays no grossly identifiable lesions. Representative sections are processed. Section summary: 1FSA. frozen section control 1A-B. addtional representative sections 2. Specimen 2 is labeled \"omentum\" on both the requisition and the container. Received in formalin is a piece of lobular fatty tissue, 23.6 x 9.3 x up to 3.4 cm. Sectioning and palpation reveals multiple firm, tan-gray to yellow masses, up to 3.7 cm in maximum dimension. Representative sections are processed in cassettes 2A-B. 3. Specimen 3 is labeled \"right colon and peritoneum\" on both the requisition and the container. Received in formalin is a 22 cm segment of colon, contiguous with a 10 cm segment of terminal ileum. There is an attached appendix, 8.8 x up to 2.3 cm. The appendix displays no gross perforation. Adherent to the mesoappendix is a portion of fibrofatty tissue, 11.5 x 6.8 x up to 3.3 cm, including peritoneum. The appendix displays no gross perforation. The colon displays up to 5.5 cm of attached mesentery. There is up to 12 cm of attached omentum at the distal aspect of the colon. The proximal and distal margins are closed with surgical staples. When opened, the colon displays a tan, velvety mucosa arranged in transverse folds. There are occasional thickened folds with no discrete masses. The mucosal circumference ranges up to 11 cm. There is 1 diverticula noted. The ileocecal valve is grossly unremarkable. The small bowel mucosa is tan-yellow and velvety and is grossly free of lesions. Sectioning through the appendix reveals mucinous and purulent material. Sectioning through the peritoneum revealed no discrete nodularity. Sectoring through the attached mesentery reveals 13 candidate lymph nodes, up to 1.7 cm in maximum dimension. Each is totally submitted. Sectioning through the omentum reveals 3 firm foci of white discoloration, up to 1.3 cm in maximum dimension. Also present loose within the specimen container is 1 additional piece of palpably firm fatty tissue, 3.2 x 1.7 x 1.2 cm.

COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue, block 3AJ from the right colon (cecum), controls react appropriately) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing.

Right colon and peritoneum\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - The mesoappendix and adherent peritoneal soft tissue are involved by a dense inflammatory reaction but do not appear to contain adenocarcinoma or mucin, and therefore the tumor is designated stage T4a (instead of T4b). Metastasis to the peritoneum is documented in the operative report, and is the basis for the designation of stage M1b (omental metastasis alone would be stage M1a). Immunohistochemical stains for mismatch repair proteins and other ancillary studies (KRAS, BRAF, and NRAS) are pending, and results will be issued separately.\n\n\n"
