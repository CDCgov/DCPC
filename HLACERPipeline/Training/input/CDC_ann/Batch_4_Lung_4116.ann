Received fresh for frozen section labeled \"left upper lobe wedge\" is a triangular- shaped specimen stapled on 2 ends. The specimen measures approximately 5 x 2.5 x 1.4 cm. The specimen has a nodular area measuring approximately 1.5 cm in diameter and lying approximately 0.5 cm from the nearest stapled margin. The overlying pleura is grossly unremarkable. The staple lines are cut away, and the exposed surgical margin is inked black. A representative section is submitted for frozen section. Cassette labels: 1FS, frozen section control; 1A-1B, remainder of specimen (minus stapled margins). (TH9/dcj) 2. Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled \"left upper lobe\" is a lobectomy specimen minus the wedge resection previously submitted. Gross inspection reveals several hilar lymph nodes that appear grossly unremarkable. No tumor is visualized or palpated near the bronchial margin. The specimen is placed in formalin for permanent fixation. (TH9/dcj) Received in formalin labeled \", left upper lobe for bronchial margin\" is a 229 g, 18.5 x 8.5 x 4.0 cm upper lobe of left lung. The visceral pleura is pink-red to pink-purple, displays multiple focal areas of adhesions as well as multiple staple lines ranging from 5.0 to 8.0 cm in length. Three bronchial margins are identified grossly at the hilum measuring 1.5 x 0.7 cm, 1.2 x 0.7 cm, and 1.3 x 0.5 cm. The staple lines near the hilum are removed and the underlying parenchyma is inked in blue. The staple line located on the anterior pleural surface is removed and the underlying parenchyma is inked in green. The pleural surface is inked in black. Serial sectioning reveals a 2.5 x 2.3 x 2.0 cm circumscribed area of hemorrhage. It is presumed that this is the area of the biopsy resection from specimen 1. This area of hemorrhage comes within 1.5 cm of the nearest bronchial margin. No residual tumor is identified grossly. The remaining parenchyma is red-purple, homogenous, glistening and spongy. Two possible hilar lymph nodes are identified 0.7 cm and 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 2A-B, vessel and bronchial margin, 4/1 each; 2C-D, area of hemorrhage in relation to margin, 1/1 each; 2E, uninvolved parenchyma, 1/1; 2F, possible intact lymph nodes, 2/1. 3. Received in formalin labeled \", inferior pulmonary lymph node\" are 2 tan to tan-yellow irregular soft tissue fragments measuring 0.8 cm and 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. Both fragments are submitted intact in cassette 3A. 2/1. 4. Received in formalin labeled \", AP window node\" are 2 tan-gray rubbery lymph nodes measuring 1.0 cm and 1.7 cm in greatest dimension. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes 4A-B with 1 bisected node in each cassette. 2/1 each.\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - Left lung mass\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\n1, 2.
