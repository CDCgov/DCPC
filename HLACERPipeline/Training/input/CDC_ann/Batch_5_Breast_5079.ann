The external surface is painted with silver\nnitrate and the insertion side of the wire is overcoated with blue dye. The specimen\nis serially sectioned from one end to the other into 6 slices. The cut surfaces\nreveal a well-circumscribed, tan, firm nodule measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm in slice\n#3-#4 [referring to the pictures].The nodular lesion is within less than 0.3 cm of\nthe inked surface of the specimen. The specimen is submitted in toto as follows:\nA1-A3 perpendicular sections of slice #1\nA4-A5 slice #2, bisected\nA6-A7 slice #3, bisected with block A7 containing the nodule with the closest\nresection margin\nA8-A9 slice #4, bisected with block A9 containing the nodule with the closest\nresection margin\nA10-A11 slice #5, bisected\nA 12-A 14 perpendicular sections of slice #6\nYM\nIschemic time: Not available [tissue removal time and time in formalin are not\navailable]\nTissue fixation time: 3 days\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nRIGHT BREAST LUMP\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\nRIGHT BREAST TISSUE: PENDING CONSULTATION REPORT\n   - MALIGNANT PAPILLARY DUCTAL EPITHELIAL NEOPLASM. PLEASE SEE COMMENT.\nCOMMENT:\nSections examined reveal reveal mammary fibroadipose tissue showing malignant ductal\nepithelial neoplasm with papillary architecture and intermediate to high degree of\nnuclear atypia. The myoepithelial markers [SMM and p63] highlight the periphery of\nthe lesion as well as the fibrovascular cores. There is one focus in slide \"A5\"\nthat shows absent/interrupted myoepithelial cell layer. In slide \"A9\" markedly\ncauterized duct [precluding further interpretation] is seen at the cauterized margin,\nand in slide \"A5\" detached groups of malignant ductal cells are seen at the\ncauterized surgical resection margin. The differential diagnoses include papillary\nductal carcinoma in situ, encapsulated papillary carcinoma and invasive papillary\ncarcinoma. The surrounding breast tissue shows dilated ducts with apocrine\nmetaplasia, periductal fibrosis and hyalinosis and mild mononuclear inflammatory cell\ninfiltrate, evidence of fat necrosis and old hemorrhage. The case will be sent for\nsecond opinion and possible performance of biomarkers if indicated.\nIn compliance with the department's Quality Assurance Policy, the case was peer\nreviewed intradepartmentally. The above is a consensus opinion.\nThe technical aspect of immunohistochemical stains is processed at Dynacare Medical\nLaboratory, 1100 Bennett Road, Bowmanville, Ontario.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nRIGHT BREAST TISSUE WITH WIRE\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\n1\n\n\n"
