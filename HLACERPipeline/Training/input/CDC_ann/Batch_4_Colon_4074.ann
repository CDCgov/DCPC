Terminal ileum measures 6.5 cm in length x 2.7 cm in average diameter. Cecum and right colon measure 18.0 cm in length x 5.5 cm in average diameter at cecum and 5.0 cm in diameter at distal surgical margin of resection. Serosal surface is largely covered by fat and occasional adhesions; however, visible areas are smooth and glistening. Opening the bowel reveals a 100% circumferential non-perforating mass in the right colon measuring 4.8 x 4.5 x 2.0 cm and extending to within 3.5 cm of the distal margin, 18.0 cm of the proximal margin, and 3.5 cm of the radial margin. Mass appears to extend through the bowel wall into the fat. Mucosa of terminal ileum, cecum, and right colon are otherwise unremarkable with no additional masses, nodules, or irregularities. Appendix is absent. Serosal surface overlying mass inked black. Thin sectioning and palpation of attached mesenteric fat reveals 26 pink-tan rubbery firm nodules consistent with lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. A single gray-white indurated area is also present measuring 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. A portion of omentum is loosely attached to the mesenteric fat and is sectioned revealing no obvious masses, nodules, or irregularities. Slide key: Cassette 1A, sections opposing surgical margin of resection; 1B, radial margin; 1C and 1D, sections mass with adjacent fat; 1E and 1f, sections mass with overlying inked serosal surface; 1G, section terminal ileum and indurated area within fat; 1H, 9 lymph nodes; 1I, 8 lymph nodes; 1J, 9 lymph nodes.
