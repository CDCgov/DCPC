Received fresh for intraoperative consultation, additionally\n labeled \"left sentinel lymph node #1\" is a 3 cm in greatest dimension\n portion of yellow, soft lobulated adipose tissue containing 2 palpable\n lymph node candidates (0.7 cm in greatest dimension each). One of the\n nodes is inked blue, both are bisected, a touch prep made and both nodes\n submitted in A.\n Frozen section diagnosis: Benign\n Part 2. Received in formalin, additionally labeled \"left central\n lumpectomy\" is a 41 g, 5.0 cm (superior-inferior) x 7.5 cm\n (medial-lateral) x 4.5 cm (superficial-deep) ovoid portion of\n yellow-white fibrofatty soft tissue surfaced by a tan, rubbery wrinkled\n ellipse of skin (7.1 x 4.2 cm). There is a short suture designating\n superior and a long suture designating lateral. The specimen is inked\n as follows: anterior- superior = blue; anterior-inferior = green and\n deep = black. The skin displays a 1 cm in greatest dimension everted\n nipple which is partially hypo-pigmented with irregularly thickened skin\n and hypopigmentation extending from the nipple approximately 2.5 x 2 cm\n medial and superior. The lesion is 0.7 cm from the closest peripheral\n skin edge at approximately 12:00 and 2 cm from the closest medial tip.\n The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into 17\n slices.

While this is a very unusual presentation, the superficial\n location and connection to epidermis clearly indicate that the tumor\n represents a cutaneous tumor rather than a pure squamous \"metaplastic\n carcinoma\" of primary breast/mammary epithelial origin. As the tumor is\n considered a cutaneous primary, pTNM pathologic staging for breast\n primary is deferred for this lesion. Results discussed with Dr.\n on 9/7/2017.\n\n\n"
