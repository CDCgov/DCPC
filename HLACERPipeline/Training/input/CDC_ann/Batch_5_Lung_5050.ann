Lung (left upper lobe), biopsy:\n- Poorly differentiated carcinoma (see comment)\n\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\n2008 Rt buttock Sarcoma\n\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nSee microscopic description below. The overall features are in keeping with a poorly differentiated carcinoma. There are focal areas demonstrating glandular morphology that stain positive for TTF-1 and CK7. These areas are in keeping with an adenocarcinoma; however, there are also areas of more poorly differentiated tumor that stain for keratins AE1/AE3 and cam 5.2 only. This may represent areas of dedifferentiation. Given the focal areas showing squamoid morphology, the differential diagnosis could also include adenosquamous carcinoma. \n\nThe patient's history of prior malignant fibrous histiocytoma (undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma) is noted, but there are no features in the current biopsy material to suggest metastatic sarcoma.\n\nMicroscopic Description: \nSections show a poorly differentiated malignant epithelioid neoplasm growing primarily in solid sheets with focal areas of acinar formation and a few nests showing a vaguely squamoid morphology. The malignant cells are polygonal with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei and ample eosinophilic cytoplasm. There is necrosis. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells stain diffusely positive for pankeratin (AE1/AE3) and low molecular weight keratin (Cam5.2). There is patchy positive staining of malignant cells for TTF-1, CK7, and BER-EP4, rare cells stain for CK5 and p63, and there is focal staining for GATA-3. They are negative for ER and calretinin. \n\n\n\n"
