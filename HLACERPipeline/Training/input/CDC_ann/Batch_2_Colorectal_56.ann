The  resection margin is received stapled. The serosa is gray-white,  smooth and shiny. The lumen is void of contents. The wall is 0.3 cm  thick. No nodules, masses or lesions are identified. Ink code: black -  proximal. Section code: (A1) appendix, representative. (2) The specimen consists of an opened, unoriented segment of colon  (length - 20.8 cm, resection margin #1 diameter - 3.5 cm; resection  margin #2 diameter - 2.6 cm) with attached mesocolon (up to 8.5 cm in  depth). The resection margins are received stapled. The mucosa is  tan with normal folds and contains a tan-pink, rubbery, polypoid mass  (3.8 x 2.8 x 1.0 cm). The mass is 2.8 cm from resection margin #1,  12.5 cm from resection margin #2, 7.3 cm from the radial resection  margin and 1.5 cm from the serosa. The mass does not appear to extend  into the mesocolon. No other nodules, masses or lesions are  identified. Multiple possible lymph nodes (0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm - 0.9 x  0.6 x 0.4 cm) are identified. Ink code: black - resection margin;  blue - serosa. Section code: (B1) resection margin #1 with mass,  longitudinally sectioned, representative; (B2) resection margin #2,  longitudinally sectioned, representative; (B3) radial resection  margin, representative; (B4) mass with serosa, representative;  (B5-B8) mass, representative; (B9, B10) multiple intact lymph nodes.
