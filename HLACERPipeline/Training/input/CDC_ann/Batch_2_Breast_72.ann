This assay is used for diagnostic determination of the HER2 protein over-expression in paraffin embedded, formalin fixed breast cancer tissue on the Ventana Benchmark. The specimen is processed using a polymer detection system. The membrane staining of the tumor is determined either by manual score or image analysis. This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic use. The score is reported as per package insert; 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+. This test is used for clinical purposes. A rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone SP1) that recognized the Estrogen Receptor is used to perform immunohistochemistry on routinely fixed (formalin) paraffin embedded tissue on the Ventana Benchmark. The specimen is processed using a polymer detection system. The percentage of stained tumor nuclei is determined either manually or by image analysis. This test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use. This test is used for clinical purposes. A rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone 1E2) that recognized the Progesterone Receptor is used to perform immunohistochemistry on routinely fixed (formalin) paraffin embedded tissue on the Ventana Benchmark. The specimen is processed using a polymer detection system. The percentage of stained tumor nuclei is determined either manually or by image analysis. This test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use. This test is used for clinical purposes. A rabbit monoclonal antibody (clone 30-9) that recognized Ki67 is used to perform immunohistochemistry on routinely fixed (formalin) paraffin embedded tissue on the Ventana Benchmark. The specimen is processed using a polymer detection system. The percentage of stained tumor nuclei is determined either manually or by image analysis. This test is intended for in vitro diagnostic use. This test is used for clinical purposes. Intended Use (when used as Prognostic/Predictive Markers): This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use. Estrogen Receptor (ER) (SP1) is a rabbit monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is intended for the qualitative detection of estrogen receptor (ER) antigen in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. ER is a rabbit monoclonal antibody that recognizes human estrogen receptor alpha. This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use. Progesterone Receptor (PR) (1E2) is a rabbit monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is intended for the qualitative detection of progesterone receptor (PR) antigen in sections of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue. PR is a rabbit monoclonal antibody that recognizes the A and B forms of the human progesterone receptor. This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use. HER2 (4B5) is a rabbit monoclonal antibody intended for the semi-quantitative detection of HER2 antigen in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded normal and neoplastic tissue. The HER2 protein is expressed as a level detectable by immunohistochemistry in up to 20 percent of adenocarcinomas from various sites. This antibody is intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) use. Ki-67 (30-9) is a rabbit monoclonal antibody (IgG) directed against C-terminal portion of Ki-67 antigen. Staining for Ki-67 can be used to aid in assessing the proliferative activity of normal and neoplastic tissue. Ki-67 is a nuclear protein expressed in proliferating cells. During the cell cycle, the Ki-67 antigen is present in the G1, S, G2 and M phase but is absent in the G0 (quiescent phase).

Any image(s) that accompany this report is/are a representative image(s) only and should not be used to render a diagnosis. HER2 testing at Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc., is performed in compliance with the 2013 updated ASCO/CAP Clinical Practice Guidelines and Recommendations for HER2 testing in Breast Cancer. If the result is EQUIVOCAL (2+), it must be confirmed by an alternative assay such as FISH or Dual ISH. REF: Wolff AC, et al. Recommendations for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing in breast cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American pathologists Clinical Practice Guideline Update. J Clin Oncol. 2013 Nov 1;31(31):3997-4013. HER2 and ER/PR ASCO/CAP guidelines require fixation in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 72 hours. Fixation times less than 6 hours may not adequately preserve cell proteins. Fixation times longer than 72 hours may cause excess cross-linking of proteins reducing the antigen available for staining. Either scenario can cause reduced staining; hence false negative results are possible and should be considered for these situations if the HER2 IHC score is less than 3+ or ER or PR is negative (no staining or <1% positive). It is recommended that specimens fixed longer than 72 hours with HER2 IHC scores less than 3+ be confirmed by HER2 FISH or Dual ISH. The time from biopsy/excision to fixation in formalin (cold ischemic time) must be less than 1 hour. Time to fixation (cold ischemic time) greater than 1 hour should be interpreted with caution. HER2 testing, mainly HER2 by FISH, is particularly vulnerable since excessive cold ischemic time results in preferential loss of HER2 probe signals that may lead to false negative results. The immunohistochemistry tests performed at Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc. were validated on tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The performance characteristics of the tests performed on tissue processed in other fixatives is not known.
