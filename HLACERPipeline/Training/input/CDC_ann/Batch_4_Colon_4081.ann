COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing.

This result is consistent with a competent mismatch repair function. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS).<BR/><BR/>Microsatellite Instability Analysis has multifaceted clinical utility: as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response; as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for colorectal carcinoma; and as a genetic risk biomarker for the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as Lynch Syndrome.<BR/><BR/>As an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy biomarker, recent literature (Le, et al., <i>N Engl J Med</i> 372:2509-2520; Topolian, et al., <i>Nature Reviews Cancer</i> 16:275-287) indicates that, in general, patients that are Microsatellite Stable (MSS) have a poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.<BR/><BR/>MSS tumors have poorer prognosis than MSI-H tumors, and better response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. <BR/><BR/>As a genetic risk biomarker, the result of MSS is inconsistent with Lynch syndrome. However, if the clinical suspicion remains high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result, consideration should be given to a genetic consult to direct additional testing. <BR/><BR/>Interpretation of this result of MSS in the context of other clinical and laboratory findings is strongly recommended.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist and representative areas of tumor and normal tissue selected. These areas were microdissected from the surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA extracted using standard methods (QIAGEN QIASymphony). The tumor and normal DNA were separately PCR amplified for five microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27; Promega Corp.), and size fractionated via capillary electrophoresis (Life Technologies 3500xl). The tumor and normal profiles were compared to determine the presence of altered microsatellite profiles. The analytic sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10-20% and is dependent on the size and clonality of any instability. The presence of instability in less than 10-20% of the DNA examined will not be detected. This assay uses reagents that may be marked as Research Use Only or Analyte Specific Reagent.
