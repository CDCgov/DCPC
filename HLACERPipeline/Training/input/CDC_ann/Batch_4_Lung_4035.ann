Microscopic examination confirmed the presence of tumor corresponding to the above referenced accession number.

The encoded protein responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. Mutations in <em>TP53</em> are associated with a variety of human cancers, including hereditary cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and are generally associated with a poor prognosis. Targeted therapies may be available in an investigational context that directly or indirectly target <em>TP53.</em></p> <p>PD-L1 expression was assessed with the FDA-approved 22C3 pharmDx qualitative immunohistochemical assay. PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint modulator expressed by tumor cells and tumor infiltrating immune cells. Inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 interactions by monoclonal antibodies may prevent T-cell suppression throughout the tumor microenvironment and restore host immunity against tumors. This patient may be eligible for treatment with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), approved in patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 as determined by an FDA-approved test and who have disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. However, positive PD-L1 status may not consistently predict patient benefit across cancer types, with a less than 50% response rate in high PD-L1 expressing tumors, and some PD-L1 negative patients also deriving benefit. </p>\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nFISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis detected no evidence of an ALK (2p23) gene rearrangement. However, 1-4 additional copies of ALK were observed in 70% of the cells, consistent with gain of the 2p23 chromosome region.    FISH revealed no evidence of MET (7q31.2) gene amplification. The MET/CEP7 ratio was 0.99. However, 1-8 additional copies of MET and CEP7 (centromere 7) were detected in 29% of cells analyzed, indicating polysomy of chromosome 7.    FISH analysis revealed no evidence of a RET (10q11.21) gene rearrangement. However, 1-2 additional copies of RET were detected in 46% of cells analyzed.    FISH revealed no evidence of HER2 (17q12) gene amplification. The HER2/CEP17 ratio was 1.05. However, 1-5 additional copies of HER2 and CEP17 (centromere 17) were detected in 44% of cells analyzed, indicating polysomy of chromosome 17.    Overall, these results are indicative of a complex abnormal karyotype (3 or more abnormalities) likely predicting for a rapid disease progression and a poor treatment outcome. Monitoring for these abnormalities may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.    No gene rearrangements for ROS1 (6q22.1) were detected. It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with classic cytogenetics, clinical, flow cytometric, and morphological data is recommended, if available.    FISH analysis was performed in interphase cells using the ALK (2p23; FDA-approved), ROS1 (6q22.1), and the RET (10q11.21) dual color, break apart rearrangement DNA probes and the MET (7q31.2)/CEP7(centromere 7) and CEP17(centromere 17)/HER2 (17q12) dual color DNA amplification probes (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL).
