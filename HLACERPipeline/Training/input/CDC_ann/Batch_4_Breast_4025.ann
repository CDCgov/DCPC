Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"left breast biopsy\" are 4 cores of yellow-red tissue, 0.4 to 1.1 cm in length with diameters varying from 0.1 to 0.2 cm.

Rare focus suspicious but not confirmed for angiolymphatic invasion.   See microscopic description. Immunohistochemical stains for Ki-67, p53, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and HER-2/neu have been performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. Positive and negative controls react appropriately. The results are as follows:  Estrogen Receptor (SP1): to be repeated and reported in addendum Progesterone Receptor (1E2): heterogeneous staining, 2-3+ nuclear staining, 30%     of nuclei averaged Ki-67 (30-9): 30-40% of nuclei (High labeling index) p53 (BP5311): 1+ nuclear staining, <1% of nuclei (negative) ERBB2/Her2 (4B5): 2+ (inderminate for overexpression); FISH pending, result to be     reported separately. Please see microscopic description for details.\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nAddendum Report: Addendum issued to report results of prognostic marker. The breast panel of prognostic markers was provided in the original report, with the exception of ER, which is here provided. Immunohistochemical stain for estrogen receptor has been performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. Positive and negative controls react appropriately. The results are as follows:  Estrogen Receptor (SP1): 3+ nuclear staining, approx100% of nuclei  ## End of auxiliary report ## Fish Report: FISH - NEGATIVE for HER2 oncogene amplification by FISH analysis  NEGATIVE for chromosome 17 polysomy by FISH analysis       ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.microscopic examination\n\nThe tumor grade is based on the following combined Nottingham scoring: tubules 3, nuclei 2-3, mitoses 1; total score 7 of 9. Ductal carcinoma in situ is not observed. A rare focus suspicious for angiolymphatic invasion is observed on the last H and E level and on several levels of the subsequent IHC stained slides (though not CD31). A small panel of immunostains is applied with satisfactory positive and negative controls. E-cadherin is positive, confirming ductal differentiation. CD31 fails to confirm angiolymphatic invasion as the focus of interest is no longer present on the immunostained slide.  Her2/neu Immunohistochemistry Report  Block: 1  Specimen Site: right  Specimen Type: (needle biopsy)  Fixative: Formalin  Time to fixation: Unavailable  Duration of fixation: 10 hrs  Antibody used: Clone 4B5 (Ventana), on Ventana Benchmark.  Controls: high protein expression,  Adequacy of sample for evaluation: Adequate Results:  Percentage of invasive tumor cells exhibiting  complete membrane staining: heterogeneous staining, approximately 15% overall show weak to moderate complete membrane staining Uniformity of staining: absent Homogeneous, dark circumferential staining: absent Interpretation: Equivocal (2+) for HER2 protein overexpresion; (FISH will be done and reported separately). This quantitative immunohistochemical evaluation of Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 (HER-2) is performed in accordance with all current guidelines as recommended by the ASCO and CAP.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nRight breast cores\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nFISH Comments - The HER2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) did not reveal amplification of the HER2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 1.08 and a Her2 copy number of 2.28, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. There was no evidence of polysomy/polyploidy or genetic heterogeneity. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin for 10hrs (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
