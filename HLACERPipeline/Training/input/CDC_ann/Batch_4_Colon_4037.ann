The terminal ileum measures 7.0 cm in length with an average circumference of 5.0 cm. The mucosal folds are pink-tan and range in the usual manner. The wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. No polyps or lesions are found within the terminal ileum. The cecum and right colon measure 31.2 cm in length having a varying circumference ranging from 6.5 cm near the distal margin up to 14.0 cm near the ileocecal valve. Opening of the specimen reveals a circumferential pink-tan to yellow centrally ulcerated mass, 10.0 x 8.5 cm. The mass is located 11.0 cm from the proximal margin and 15.3 cm from the distal margin. Upon sectioning, the mass varies in thickness ranging from 0.6 cm up to 1.5 cm and displays areas of gross invasion into the underlying wall. The mass is located approximately 2.7 cm from the nearest resected radial margin. The remainder of the cecum and right colon display pink-tan mucosal folds that range in the usual manner. The wall averages 0.2 cm. The surrounding serosa and subserosal adipose tissue appear grossly unremarkable. The attached appendix measures 6.0 cm in length and has a varying diameter ranging from 0.5 cm near the tip up to 1.0 cm near the mid appendix. The serosa is pink-tan and displays focal adhesions. The wall averages 0.1 cm in thickness. Upon sectioning, the lumen is patent filled with scant light green fluid. No perforations are grossly identified. Sectioning of the surrounding fatty tissue reveals multiple lymph nodes. These lymph nodes range in size from 0.3 cm up to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension. No gross tumor involvement is evident. Also attached is a portion of omentum, 13.5 x 10.6 x 3.0 cm. Sectioning of the omentum reveals a lobulated fatty cut surface with vessels. No firm areas or implants are identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A, margins, 2/1; 1B-C, full thickness bisected section of mass with nearest radial margin, junction of the 2 sections is inked green, radial margin is inked blue (1B contains mass half, 1C contains radial margin half), 1/1 each; 1D-E, bisected full thickness section of mass at deepest invasion, junction of the 2 sections inked green, blue ink indicates radial margin (1D contains half mass, 1E contains radial margin half), 1/1 each; 1F, section of mass displaying wall replacement, 1/1; 1G-H, mass with adjacent normal mucosa, 1/1 each; 1I, section of mass with blue inked serosa, 1/1; 1J, appendix with appendiceal orifice, 3/1; 1K, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1L, 4 lymph nodes, 4/1; 1M, 3 lymph nodes, 3/1; 1N, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1O, 3 lymph nodes, 3/1; 1P, 1 lymph node serially sectioned; 1Q, 2 lymph nodes (green inked lymph node is uncut), 3/1; 1R-T, sections of vessels with surrounding fatty tissue, R 4/1, S 2/1, T 3/1.

Loss of DNA mismatch repair enzyme MLH-1 with secondary loss of PMS-2.   2. Additional testing for BRAF mutation analysis is PENDING (results will be reported separately).   3. See comment.  COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue, block 1I from the right colon, controls react appropriately) per EGAPP recommendations reveals loss of nuclear expression of DNA mismatch repair enzyme MLH-1 with secondary loss of PMS-2, and intact staining for mismatch repair enzymes MSH-2 and MSH-6. These results indicate DEFECTIVE DNA MISMATCH REPAIR (MMR) ENZYME FUNCTION within this tumor. Hereditary-associated, as well as sporadic, colorectal carcinomas (CRC) that have defective mismatch repair have been shown to have distinct survival outcome and treatment-associated characteristics (patients with defective MMR function do not typically benefit from fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy). In order to determine whether this reflects a germ line loss of MLH-1 due to Lynch syndrome, or acquired hypermethylation-related loss of MLH-1, BRAF mutation analysis is required and is in process. The results of the BRAF mutation analysis will be reported separately, and a comprehensive final report addressing all testing methods will be issued when those results are available. Please contact the signout pathologist if you have any questions in the interim.
