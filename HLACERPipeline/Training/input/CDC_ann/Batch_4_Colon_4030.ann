COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing. [References available on request].\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nFISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a deletion of PTEN (10q23) in 62% of cells analyzed. Loss of PTEN, a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) has been implicated in a number of human malignancies. PTEN deletion is an independent prognostic marker and is associated with tumor progression and a poor prognosis in various neoplasms.    FISH revealed no evidence of MET gene amplification. The MET/CEP7 ratio was 0.99. However, 1-2 additional copies of MET and CEP7 were detected in 23% of cells analyzed, suggesting the presence of polysomy of chromosome 7. Gain of MET and/or chromosome 7 is an independent prognostic factor associated with a poor prognosis in many neoplasms, including colorectal cancer.    FISH revealed no evidence of HER2 gene amplification. The HER2/CEP17 ratio was 1.01. However, 1-2 additional copies of HER2 and CEP17 were detected in 15% of cells analyzed, suggesting the presence of polysomy of chromosome 17.    Overall, these results are indicative of a complex abnormal karyotype (3 or more abnormalities) likely predicting for a rapid disease progression and a poor treatment outcome. Monitoring for these anomalies may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.    No evidence of PIK3CA (3q26) gene amplification or deletion of TP53 (17p13.1) or NF1 (17q11.2) were detected. However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.    FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  CEP7/MET (Centromere 7/7q31) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  CEP17/HER2 (Centromere 17/17q12) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  CEP10/PTEN (Centromere 10/10q23) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  RPN1/PIK3CA (3q21/3q26) (MetaSystems Group Inc., Newton, MA)  TP53/NF1 (17p13.1/17q11.2) (MetaSystems Group Inc., Newton, MA)    References:  Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2010, 2(1): a001008; Oncotarget. 2014, 5(15): 5873 5892; J Clin Pathol. 2015, 68(4):253-7; World J Biol Chem. 2015, 6(2):16-27; Mol Biol Int. 2014, 2014:852748; Int J Oncol. 2012, 40(3):639-44; Clin Cancer Res. 2010, 16(17):4325-30. Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and total RNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated RNA was subjected to reverse transcription, and double stranded DNA was constructed. The specimen was universal-tagged and barcoded, and subjected to hemi-nested multiplex PCR using gene-specific primers and universal tag specific primers (Archer FusionPlex chemistry). The products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using Archer Analysis Software, v4.1. The analytic sensitivity is approximately 5 RNA molecules encoding the fusion, and is dependent on the specific fusion event present. All fusions are relative to the reported reference transcript. This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.<br/><br/>The following genes analyzed, including specific exons and direction of analysis, are listed in the table at the end of this report.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kaye, Mol Cancer There 8.6(2009):1399-1408; Mitelman, et al., Nature Rev Cancer 7(2007): 233-245; Parker; Kumar-Sinha, et al., Genome Medicine 7(2015): 129; Cantwell-Dorris et al.

Lierman et al., Leukemia. 23 (2009):845-851 Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist and representative areas of tumor and normal tissue selected. These areas were microdissected from the surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA extracted using standard methods (QIAGEN QIASymphony). The tumor and normal DNA were separately PCR amplified for five microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27; Promega Corp.), and size fractionated via capillary electrophoresis (Life Technologies 3500xl). The tumor and normal profiles were compared to determine the presence of altered microsatellite profiles. The analytic sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10-20% and is dependent on the size and clonality of any instability. The presence of instability in less than 10-20% of the DNA examined will not be detected. This assay uses reagents that may be marked as Research Use Only or Analyte Specific Reagent. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. Portions of this test use reagents designated by the manufacturer as for research use, not for clinical use.

This result is consistent with a competent mismatch repair function. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS).<BR/><BR/>Microsatellite Instability Analysis has multifaceted clinical utility: as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response; as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for colorectal carcinoma; and as a genetic risk biomarker for the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as Lynch Syndrome.<BR/><BR/>As an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy biomarker, recent literature (Le, et al., <i>N Engl J Med</i> 372:2509-2520; Topolian, et al., <i>Nature Reviews Cancer</i> 16:275-287) indicates that, in general, patients that are Microsatellite Stable (MSS) have a poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.<BR/><BR/>MSS tumors have poorer prognosis than MSI-H tumors, and better response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. <BR/><BR/>As a genetic risk biomarker, the result of MSS is inconsistent with Lynch syndrome. However, if the clinical suspicion remains high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result, consideration should be given to a genetic consult to direct additional testing. <BR/><BR/>Interpretation of this result of MSS in the context of other clinical and laboratory findings is strongly recommended.

DNA quality was optimal. Excellent gene coverage was achieved which passed our internal quality checks. <strong>TNFAIP3 R502-A506del, BRCA2 R2418I, SMAD4 G386D and RUNX1 L56S mutations were detected</strong> by targeted next generation sequencing interrogating the hot-spot regions of the genes summarized in the NGS technical table. </p> <p>The protein encoded by the TNFAIP3 gene is a zinc finger protein and ubiqitin-editing enzyme, and has been shown to inhibit NF-kappa B activation as well as TNF-mediated apoptosis. The encoded protein, which has both ubiquitin ligase and deubiquitinase activities, is involved in the cytokine-mediated immune and inflammatory responses. In the setting of neoplasia, somatic mutations in TNFAIP3 have been described in a variety of solid and hematologic neoplasms and are thought to reflect changes seen in inactivated tumor suppressor genes. Consideration may also be given to therapies that target the NF-kappa B pathway. </p> <p>Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer increased risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which functions in DNA repair. BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele. Certain mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 may be associated with sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.</p> <p>SMAD4 gene encodes a member of the Smad family of signal transduction proteins. Smad proteins are phosphorylated and activated by transmembrane serine-threonine receptor kinases in response to TGF-beta signaling. The product of this gene forms homomeric complexes and heteromeric complexes with other activated Smad proteins, which then accumulate in the nucleus and regulate the transcription of target genes. Mutations or deletions in this gene have been found in a variety of cancers.</p> <p>RUNX1 mutations have been described both in MDS and AML. In either clinical context, the presence of a RUNX1 mutation is associated with adverse prognosis and leukemic progression. RUNX1 mutations have also been described in a variety of solid tumors, although the clinical significance of this mutation is not well established. <strong>Of note, this RUNX1 L56S alteration is referenced in both cancer (COSMIC) and germ-line (dbSNP) databases. As a result, a germ-line alteration cannot be completely excluded and thus its clinical significance in this context is uncertain. </strong> Similar analysis on buccal swab may be helpful for further clarification. Clinical correlation is required. </p>  ## End of auxiliary report ## Smart Genomics Summary: SGTS Impression - <p>Review of the accompanying pathology report indicates a history of Adenocarcinoma.
