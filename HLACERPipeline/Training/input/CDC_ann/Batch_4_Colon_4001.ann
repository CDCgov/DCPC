A black suture is identified at 1 aspect which, per the requisition, marks the proximal margin. The serosal surface is tan-pink with multiple red-purple shaggy adhesions with a moderate amount of attached pericolic fat. The serosa is inked in black. The specimen is opened to reveal tan-pink, glistening, edematous mucosa with normal colonic folds and 5 distinct lesions. The 1st lesion is tan-pink, focally hyperemic, ulcerative and measures 3.2 x 2.7 x 0.1 cm. This lesion is located in the cecum and is 5.0 cm from the proximal margin, 11.8 cm from the distal margin, and 10.5 cm from the radial margin. Sectioning the lesion reveals gross invasion of the bowel wall. The 2nd mass is tan-pink, lobular and polypoid and measures 4.7 x 3.2 x 0.2 cm. The 2nd mass is 4.3 cm to the distal margin and 10.5 cm from the proximal margin. Centrally between the 1st and 2nd lesions are 3 additional tan-pink, lobular, polypoid lesions measuring 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm, 1.3 x 1.2 x 0.1 cm, and 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.2 cm. Sectioning the remaining lesion reveals only superficial mucosal involvement, no invasion is identified. Palpating the attached adipose tissue reveals multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.2-0.9 cm in greatest dimension.

This result is consistent with a competent mismatch repair function. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS).<BR/><BR/>Microsatellite Instability Analysis has multifaceted clinical utility: as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response; as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for colorectal carcinoma; and as a genetic risk biomarker for the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as Lynch Syndrome.<BR/><BR/>As an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy biomarker, recent literature (Le, et al., <i>N Engl J Med</i> 372:2509-2520; Topolian, et al., <i>Nature Reviews Cancer</i> 16:275-287) indicates that, in general, patients that are Microsatellite Stable (MSS) have a poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.<BR/><BR/>MSS tumors have poorer prognosis than MSI-H tumors, and better response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. <BR/><BR/>As a genetic risk biomarker, the result of MSS is inconsistent with Lynch syndrome. However, if the clinical suspicion remains high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result, consideration should be given to a genetic consult to direct additional testing. <BR/><BR/>Interpretation of this result of MSS in the context of other clinical and laboratory findings is strongly recommended.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist and representative areas of tumor and normal tissue selected. These areas were microdissected from the surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA extracted using standard methods (QIAGEN QIASymphony). The tumor and normal DNA were separately PCR amplified for five microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27; Promega Corp.), and size fractionated via capillary electrophoresis (Life Technologies 3500xl). The tumor and normal profiles were compared to determine the presence of altered microsatellite profiles. The analytic sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10-20% and is dependent on the size and clonality of any instability. The presence of instability in less than 10-20% of the DNA examined will not be detected. This assay uses reagents that may be marked as Research Use Only or Analyte Specific Reagent. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. Portions of this test use reagents designated by the manufacturer as for research use, not for clinical use. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. <BR/><BR/>Klump B,et al. <i>Int J Colorectal Dis</i> Vol 19:23-42, 2004; Grady WM.<i>Cancer Metastasis Rev</i> Vol 23:11-27, 2004; Umar, et al., <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> Vol 96:261-268, 2004; Popat S, Hubner R, Houlston RS. <i>Prognosis J Clin Oncol</i> Vol 23(3):609-618, 2005; Ribic CM, et al.,<i> N Engl J Med.</i> Vol 349(3):247-257, 2003; D.
