The malignant cells have highly variably sized vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli and moderate amounts of cytoplasm. No definite glandular or squamous differentiation is identified. \n Immunohistochemical stains are performed to further characterize the tumor. The tumor cells are stained with the following antibodies with the following results.

Any image(s) that accompany this report is/are a representative image(s) only and should not be used to render a diagnosis. This interpretation is contingent on the specimen and the clinical information received. Known positive cells or tissue are employed with each test and examined to ensure positivity. Positive and negative internal controls, if present, react appropriately. This analysis is an adjunct to the evaluation of the referring physician and does not represent a final diagnosis. The immunohistochemistry tests performed at Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc. were validated on tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The performance characteristics of the test performed on tissue processed in other fixatives is not known. This assay has not been validated on decalcified tissues. Results should be interpreted with caution if this specimen was decalcified given the liklihood of decreased staining or false negativity on decalcified specimens.
