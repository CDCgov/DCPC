This assay is able to detect 5% mutation in a background of wild-type DNA. Intended Use: The detection of a BRAF V600 gene mutation aids in the specific diagnosis of certain cancers, such as hairy cell leukemia, and help to identify patients with worse prognosis and who may be responsive to certain therapies in a variety of cancers.

Received fresh for intraoperative gross consultation, labeled, \"Shipp Sigmoid and upper rectum\" is a segment of large bowel measuring approximately 17 cm in length by 5 cm in average circumference. One aspect of the specimen is patent and the opposite aspect is stapled. The attached mesenteric tissue is yellow-brown and measures up to 6 cm. The length of the mesentery versus possible mesorectum cannot be grossly evaluated. The mesenteric tissue displays multiple areas of ragged adhesions (inked green). The specimen is opened along the antimesenteric aspect to reveal a 5.5 x 4.1 x 1.4 red-tan centrally ulcerative mass with raised borders. This mass is predominantly mesenteric and located 10.5 cm from the patent margin, approximately 1.4 cm from radial margin, and 4.5 cm from the stapled margin. Grossly, the mass appears to invade through the muscularis propria and into the attached fatty tissue. The remainder of the mucosa appears grossly unremarkable. The attached mesentery is sectioned and palpated to reveal multiple possible lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1- patent margin, en face A2- stapled margin, en face A3- mass to closest radial margin A4-A6- additional representative sections of the mass A7- 4 possible lymph nodes A8- 6 possible lymph nodes A9- 2 possible lymph nodes, one inked green and both bisected A10- 3 possible lymph nodes A11- 1 possible lymph node, bisected B.  Received in formalin, labeled \"Shipp-anastomotic rings\" are 2 tan-brown ragged tissue fragments measuring 2.9 x 1.8 x 1.1 cm and 2.3 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm. The specimen displays multiple sutures and silver metallic staples. The sutures and staples are removed and the specimen is sectioned. The former is submitted entirely in cassettes B1-B2 and the latter is submitted entirely in cassettes B3-B4. C. Received in formalin, labeled \"Shipp-polyp 10 cm proximal to anastomosis\" is a 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm yellow-tan ragged tissue fragment. The specimen is submitted entirely in cassette C1.
