Testing performed at Esoterix Genetic Laboratories, LLC 521 W 57th Street, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10019 800-447-8881. The TTF-1 immunohistochemical stain shows mild and variable immunoreactivity in the nuclei of tumor cells, adjacent alveolar lining cells showing 4+ immunoreactivity. Appropriate control slides are verified. The mucicarmine stain is negative. (JED/lgt) The PDL-1 (keytruda) is reported separately: Low expression with tumor proportions score 10%. Epithelial growth factor receptor mutation analysis, also reported separately, is: Not detected. (JED/lgt) ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.microscopic examination\n\nThe CT-guided needle core biopsies of lung, left lower lobe clinically 9 cm mass confirm the clinical suspicion of malignancy. This is an infiltrating poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma in which malignant squamous cells are organized into large islands with pleomorphic large epithelial cells containing abundant hardy eosinophilic cytoplasm, pleomorphic nuclei, many with prominent basophilic nucleoli. Focal individual cell necrosis is identified. Atypical mitotic figures are easily recognized. The adjacent non-neoplastic pulmonary parenchyma shows reactive changes. Further evaluation will include epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) by PCR as well as immunohistochemical stain TTF-1 and, to exclude a component of glandular differentiation, a mucicarmine histochemical stain. A supplemental report will follow.

The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: portions of exons 18-21, consisting of codons 699-726, 729-840, 848-869 (specifically including codons E709, G719, S768, T790, L833, L858, L861 and deletions and insertions in exons 19 and 20). <BR/><BR/>Paez, J.
