Results Table PD-L1 - KEYTRUDA (R)   Tumor Proportion Interpretation M17-21661-G1     1%        Low Expression Reference Ranges PD-L1 protein expression is determined by using the Tumor Proportion Score (TPS), which is the percentage of at least 100 viable tumor cells showing complete or partial membrane staining at greater than or equal to 1+.   TPS less than 1% = No Expression   TPS between 1% and 49% = Low Expression - Eligible for second-line treatment with KEYTRUDA (R) (pembrolizumab).   TPS greater than or equal to 50% = High Expression - Eligible for first or second-line treatment with KEYTRUDA (R) (pembrolizumab).

EGFR Gene Mutation Analysis INTERPRETATION: Negative for EGFR Mutation. Please see additional comment. Indication for Study:   Adenosquamous Carcinoma Specimen Site and Type:   Paraffin-Embedded Tissue-Lung Nucleotide Change: Amino Acid Change: Comments: No mutations were detected within the analyzed region of the EGFR gene in the sample provided for analysis. Less than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory findings for the most accurate interpretation. A subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has shown clinical responsiveness to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors gefitinib (IRESSA) and erlotinib (Tarceva), including never smokers, individuals of Asian ethnicity, and those with adenocarcinoma histology. In the majority of patients with highly responsive tumors, the tumor contains a somatic mutation within the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. The presence of a somatic EGFR mutation is significantly associated with response to gefitinib and erlotinib, and is strongly predictive of prolonged survival in NSCLC patients.
