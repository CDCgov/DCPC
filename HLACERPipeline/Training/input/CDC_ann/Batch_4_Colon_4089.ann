Loss of DNA mismatch repair enzyme MLH-1 with secondary loss of PMS-2.   2. Additional testing for BRAF mutation analysis is PENDING (results will be       reported separately).   3. See comment.\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue, controls react appropriately) per EGAPP recommendations reveals loss of nuclear expression of DNA mismatch repair enzyme MLH-1 (punctate staining, interpreted as negative) with secondary loss of PMS-2, and intact staining for mismatch repair enzymes MSH-2 and MSH-6. These results indicate DEFECTIVE DNA MISMATCH REPAIR (MMR) ENZYME FUNCTION within this tumor. Hereditary-associated, as well as sporadic, colorectal carcinomas (CRC) that have defective mismatch repair have been shown to have distinct survival outcome and treatment-associated characteristics (patients with defective MMR function do not benefit from fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy). In order to determine whether this reflects a germ line loss of MLH-1 due to Lynch syndrome, or acquired hypermethylation-related loss of MLH-1, BRAF mutation analysis is required and is in process. The results of the BRAF mutation analysis will be reported separately, and a comprehensive final report addressing all testing methods will be issued when those results are available. Please contact the signout pathologist if you have any questions in the interim. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed no evidence of MET (7q31.2) gene amplification. The MET/CEP7 ratio was 0.94. However, 1-2 additional copies of MET and CEP7 (centromere 7) were detected in 22% of cells analyzed, indicating polysomy of chromosome 7. Gain of MET and/or chromosome 7 is an independent prognostic factor associated with a poor prognosis in many neoplasms, including colorectal cancer.   FISH revealed no evidence of HER2 (17q12) gene amplification. The HER2/CEP17 ratio was 1.07. However, 1-2 additional copies of HER2 and CEP17 (centromere 17) were detected in 13% of cells analyzed, indicating polysomy of chromosome 17. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.    Monitoring for these anomalies may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.   It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  CEP7/MET (Centromere 7/7q31) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  CEP17/HER2 (Centromere 17/17q12) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)   References:  Nat Med. 2012 Feb 12;18(3):382-4; Oncol Rep. 2012 Oct;28(4):1187-92; J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1667-74.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist and representative areas of tumor and normal tissue selected. These areas were microdissected from the surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA extracted using standard methods (QIAGEN QIASymphony). The tumor and normal DNA were separately PCR amplified for five microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27; Promega Corp.), and size fractionated via capillary electrophoresis (Life Technologies 3500xl). The tumor and normal profiles were compared to determine the presence of altered microsatellite profiles. The analytic sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10-20% and is dependent on the size and clonality of any instability. The presence of instability in less than 10-20% of the DNA examined will not be detected. This assay uses reagents that may be marked as Research Use Only or Analyte Specific Reagent. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. Portions of this test use reagents designated by the manufacturer as for research use, not for clinical use. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. <BR/><BR/>Klump B,et al. <i>Int J Colorectal Dis</i> Vol 19:23-42, 2004; Grady WM.<i>Cancer Metastasis Rev</i> Vol 23:11-27, 2004; Umar, et al., <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> Vol 96:261-268, 2004; Popat S, Hubner R, Houlston RS. <i>Prognosis J Clin Oncol</i> Vol 23(3):609-618, 2005; Ribic CM, et al.,<i> N Engl J Med.</i> Vol 349(3):247-257, 2003; D.

Tumor cells show focal loss of CDX2. CDX2 expression has important prognostic value in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Loss of CDX2 expression is associated with an aggressive clinical course including infiltrative growth, and advanced T, N, M and overall stage.

This is defined as the presence of instability in 2 or more of the 5 microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27) examined. These results indicate defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) enzyme function within this tumor.<BR/><BR/>Microsatellite Instability Analysis has multifaceted clinical utility: as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response; as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for colorectal carcinoma; and as a genetic risk biomarker for the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as Lynch Syndrome.<BR/><BR/>As an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy biomarker, recent literature (Le, et al., <i>N Engl J Med</i> 372:2509-2520; Topolian, et al., <i>Nature Reviews Cancer</i> 16:275-287) indicates that, in general, patients that show a high level of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) have a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.<BR/><BR/>Hereditary as well as sporadic colorectal carcinomas (CRC) that have defective mismatch repair have been shown to have distinct survival outcome and treatment-associated characteristics. Patients with defective MMR function do not appear to benefit from fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy (J Clin Onc 2010; 28:3219-322).<BR/><BR/>As a genetic risk biomarker, the result of High Microsatellite Instability may indicate the need for genetic counseling to direct further testing for possible Lynch syndrome. Correlation with other testing results such as BRAF mutational status is recommended to aid in the diagnosis of an inherited cancer syndrome versus a sprodaic tumor.<BR/><BR/>Interpretation of this result of MSI-H in the context of other clinical and laboratory findings is strongly recommended.
