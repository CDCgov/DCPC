Based on morphology he felt\nthe biopsy material was infiltrated by a carcinomatous process. However IHC\nwork-up failed to confirm epithelial differentiation. he feels additional\nimmunohistochemistry is necessary, however, because of a worry of depleting the\nblock and the limited IHC available he recommends sending the case to mt. Sinai\nfor additional opinion from the GI group. Please await the opinion from Mt.\nSinai.\n\n\nPath report.gross description\n\nSpecimen number S16-1331 is labelled as patient \"Dale, Patricia\", tissue\n\"biopsy lesion 25cm colon\".\nThe specimen consists of six portions of tan tissue 0.2cm-0.5cm.

Within the\ninflammatory component some single cells show atypia which could be reactive. \nTo rule out malignancy, I will send the slides and blocks to Dr. X in\n HOSPITAL for consultation.
