COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing. [References available on request].  ## End of auxiliary report ## Ancillary Report: Immunoperoxidase staining was performed and evaluated with appropriate controls. Tumor cells show focal loss of CDX2. CDX2 expression has important prognostic value in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Loss of CDX2 expression is associated with an aggressive clinical course including infiltrative growth, and advanced T, N, M and overall stage.

The diagnosis was left on Dr. 's nurse's voicemail at 1000 on 8/10/2017. Ancillary studies including molecular testing have been ordered and will be reported separately. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed no evidence of HER2 (17q12) gene amplification. The HER2/CEP17 ratio was 0.79. However, 1-3 additional copies of CEP17 (centromere 17) were detected in 44% of cells analyzed. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.    Monitoring for this anomaly may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.    FISH revealed no evidence of MET (7q31.2) gene amplification. However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with classic cytogenetics, clinical, flow cytometric, and morphological data is recommended, if available.    FISH analysis was performed in interphase cells using the MET (7q31.2)/CEP7 (centromere 7) and CEP17 (centromere 17)/HER2 (17q12) dual color DNA amplification probes (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL).
