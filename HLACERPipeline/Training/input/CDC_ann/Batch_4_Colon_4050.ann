This result is consistent with a competent mismatch repair function. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS).<BR/><BR/>Microsatellite Instability Analysis has multifaceted clinical utility: as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response; as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for colorectal carcinoma; and as a genetic risk biomarker for the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as Lynch Syndrome.<BR/><BR/>As an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy biomarker, recent literature (Le, et al., <i>N Engl J Med</i> 372:2509-2520; Topolian, et al., <i>Nature Reviews Cancer</i> 16:275-287) indicates that, in general, patients that are Microsatellite Stable (MSS) have a poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.<BR/><BR/>MSS tumors have poorer prognosis than MSI-H tumors, and better response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. <BR/><BR/>As a genetic risk biomarker, the result of MSS is inconsistent with Lynch syndrome. However, if the clinical suspicion remains high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result, consideration should be given to a genetic consult to direct additional testing. <BR/><BR/>Interpretation of this result of MSS in the context of other clinical and laboratory findings is strongly recommended.

FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis detected a HER2 (17q12) gene amplification. While the HER2/CEP17 ratio was 1.70, 62% of cells had 6 or more copies of HER2 with an average copy number of 7.89. Amplification of HER2 is associated with poor prognosis in a variety of neoplasms. Tumors harboring amplification of HER2 may be responsive to HER2 inhibitors (ie., trastuzumab, lapatinib).   FISH revealed no evidence of MET (7q31.2) gene amplification. The MET/CEP7 ratio was 1.13. However, 1-2 additional copies of MET and CEP7 (centromere 7) were detected in 49% of cells analyzed, indicating polysomy of chromosome 7. Gain of MET and/or chromosome 7 is an independent prognostic factor associated with a poor prognosis in many neoplasms, including colorectal cancer.   Monitoring for these anomalies may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.   It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with classic cytogenetics, clinical, flow cytometric, and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed in interphase cells using the MET (7q31.2)/CEP7 (centromere 7) and CEP17 (centromere 17)/HER2 (17q12) dual color DNA amplification probes (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL).

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist and representative areas of tumor and normal tissue selected. These areas were microdissected from the surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA extracted using standard methods (QIAGEN QIASymphony). The tumor and normal DNA were separately PCR amplified for five microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27; Promega Corp.), and size fractionated via capillary electrophoresis (Life Technologies 3500xl). The tumor and normal profiles were compared to determine the presence of altered microsatellite profiles. The analytic sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10-20% and is dependent on the size and clonality of any instability. The presence of instability in less than 10-20% of the DNA examined will not be detected. This assay uses reagents that may be marked as Research Use Only or Analyte Specific Reagent. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. Portions of this test use reagents designated by the manufacturer as for research use, not for clinical use. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. <BR/><BR/>Klump B,et al. <i>Int J Colorectal Dis</i> Vol 19:23-42, 2004; Grady WM.<i>Cancer Metastasis Rev</i> Vol 23:11-27, 2004; Umar, et al., <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> Vol 96:261-268, 2004; Popat S, Hubner R, Houlston RS. <i>Prognosis J Clin Oncol</i> Vol 23(3):609-618, 2005; Ribic CM, et al.,<i> N Engl J Med.</i> Vol 349(3):247-257, 2003; D.
