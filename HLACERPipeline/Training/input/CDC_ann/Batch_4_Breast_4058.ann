Serially sectioning the tissue reveals 4 possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.7 to 2.2 cm in maximum dimension. The largest lymph node displays a gray-white, indurated cut surface. The nodes are totally submitted as follows: 1A, the largest lymph node, 4/1; 1B, 1 lymph node, 2/1; 1C, 1 lymph node, 2/1; 1D, 1 lymph node, 2/1.

An immunostain for CK5/6 is negative. Breast biomarkers will be performed and reported in an addendum. FISH Comments - The HER-2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) revealed amplification of the HER-2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 7.59 and a Her2 copy number of 22.16, (ratio greater or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number >6) indicating amplification.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
