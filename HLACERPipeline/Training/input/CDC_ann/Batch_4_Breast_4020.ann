Received fresh beneath a disposable radiography localizing grid in a container labeled with the patient's name \"right breast mass 1 knot superior, 2 knots lateral, 3 knots inferior, 4 knots medial\" is a 38.8 g portion of breast tissue which is 6.5 cm superior to inferior, 5.7 cm anterior to posterior and is up to 1.5 cm medial to lateral. Margins are inked as follows: Superior blue, inferior green, medial red, lateral orange and the posterior is inked black. Attached anteriorly is a 5.3 x 1.5 cm wrinkled tan skin ellipse. Neither nipple, nor axillary contents are present. The specimen is accompanied by a soft tissue radiograph displaying the highlighted presence of an area of stromal density containing a metallic clip corresponding to the A-E and 2-6 coordinates. The lateral margin in the localized area is marked with purple ink. The specimen is sequentially sectioned progressing from superior to inferior. On section the fatty parenchyma is comprised of less than 10% tan fibrous tissue. The parenchyma within the localized region is hemorrhagic, discolored yellow-tan suggestive of site of previous stereotactic biopsies. The site of probable previous biopsy is 0.1 cm to the lateral margin, 0.9 cm to the medial margin, 1.5 cm to the deep margin, greater than 2 cm to overlying skin, approximately 1 cm to the superior margin and is well away from the inferior margin. The breast tissue is sequentially sectioned progressing superior to inferior. Within the localized area is a palpable area of induration 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm which is 0.2 cm to the nearest lateral margin. The previously mentioned metallic clip is not identified. Cassette summary:   1A, perpendicular sections comprising the superior margin.   1B-1F, sequential sections comprising the entire site of previous biopsy progressing superior to inferior and to include the medial, lateral and deep margins of resection.   1G-J, sections comprising the remaining fibrous tissue.   1K, sections of skin overlying the site of previous biopsy.   1L, perpendicular sections comprising the inferior margin. NOTE: The specimen radiograph is reviewed by a pathologist. (DSP) 2.

One side is concave and the opposite is convex and has been previously marked with purple ink. The new margin is over inked orange and the old margin is inked black. Attached sutures denote \"1 knot posterior deep, 2 knots anterior superficial.\" The specimen is sequentially sectioned progressing from anteriro to deep. The cut surfaces are fatty and comprised of less than 10% tan fibrous stroma. Discrete tumor is not observed. Sequential sections comprising the entire specimen progressing anterior to deep are submitted in cassettes 2A-L. (csb) 3. Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"additional medial breast tissue ink marks new margin, 2 knots anterior, 1 knot posterior\" is a 3.6 g, 4 x 2 x 0.9 cm portion of breast tissue. Attached sutures denote \"2 knots anterior, 1 knot posterior.\" The new margin has been previously marked with purple ink and is over inked red. The old margin is inked blue. The specimen is sequentially sectioned progressing from anterior to posterior. On section, the fatty parenchyma is fatty and discrete tumor is not observed.

The DCIS measures 1.6 cm in greatest aggreate dimension on a single slide and is present in 5 contiguous slides. When combined with all factors, the roughly estimated size is 1.6 x 1.1 x 1.5 cm. It spreads into adjacent ducts, showing partial involvement and possible pagetoid spread. The background breast tissue shows varying degrees of lesser epithelial atypia as described in the diagnosis, mostly ductal, focally lobular (ALH bordering on LCIS), along with fibrocystic changes (apocrine metaplasia/cysts, usual ductal hyperplasia, fibrosis).
