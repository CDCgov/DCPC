Morphologic assessment of the lymphoid cells is slightly\nhampered due to fixation artefact (bubbly nuclei). For the most part there are\nmedium to large-sized lymphoid cells with round to irregular nuclear contours,\nfinely stippled chromatin, small basophilic nucleoli and small amounts of\ncytoplasm. There are residual, unremarkable epithelial elements scattered\nthroughout and best appreciated by the immunostain for wide molecular keratin\nnoted below. There is no evidence of necrosis, granulomas or metastatic\ndisease.\nImmunohistochemistry:\nImmunohistochemical staining is performed on the paraffin-embedded core biopsy\nwith satisfactory controls. Intitial immunostains confirm the hematolymphoid B-\ncell nature of the infiltrate (CD45/LCA+, CD20+ and negative for wide-spectrum\nkeratin, TTF-1, S100, synaptophysin, p63, napsin-A, mammaglobin, melan-A, ER,\nchromogranin, CD56). Additional immunostains show the B-cells are PAX5+,\nBCL2+(strong staining), BCL6+, MUM1+, cMYC+ (40%) and negative for CD10, CD5,\ncyclin D1, TdT and CD34. Stains for immunoglobulin light chains are non-\ncontributory assessing the clonality of these malignant B-cells. A stain for\nCD21 shows no evidence of meshworks of follicular dendritic cells. A stain for\nKi-67 highlights about 80% of the malignant B-cells consistent with a high\nproliferative index. A low number of T-cells (CD3+, CD5+) are present in the\nbackground. The stain for wide molecular weight keratin highlights residual,\nentrapped epithelial elements scattered throughout.\nIn situ hybridization:\nIn situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER) performed on\nformalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue (block A1) with satisfactory controls\nshows nearly all of the malignant lymphoid cells are EBER-negative. A few,\nscattered EBER-positive cells are present at one end of the needle core.\nGenomics:\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from this case (block A1) has been\nsubmitted in order to assess for MYC rearrangement, possibly BCL2 rearrangement\nand possibly BCL6 rearrangement by FISH. When the results of these studies are\navailable, they will appear as a separate report from the HSN clinical genomics\nlaboratory and will be integrated into this report as an addendum.\nFlow Cytometry:\nNo tissue submitted for flow cytometric analysis.\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nMultiple lung lesions.\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\nLung, right upper, CT-guided needle core biopsy:\n * B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder most consistent with diffuse large\nB-cell lymphoma, see comment.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nLung biopsy CT GUIDED CORE BX, RIGHT UPPER LUNG\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nProvided genomics testing is noncontributory with respect to further\nclassification, this diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is likely best\ndescribed as non-germinal center B-cell type according to Hans' algorithm. The\nlatter is a commonly used algorithm for dividing diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\ninto germinal center or non-germinal center B-cell type for prognostic purposes\n(reference 2). Tumors showing a germinal center B-cell phenotype are considered\nto have significantly better prognosis than tumors showing a non-germinal center\nB-cell phenotype.\nReferences:\n1.
