The serosa is tan-gray blotchy with areas of adhesions and tan-white exudate. The wall averages 0.1 cm. The lumen is filled with soft brown fecal material. The proximal margin is inked blue. Representative sections are submitted in cassette 3A to include the proximal margin, 3/1. 2. Received in formalin labeled \"\" and \"transverse colon and partial stomach\" is a portion of bilateral stapled colon, firmly adherent on the opposing side is a portion of stomach also containing staples. Also adherent to the colon is a part of omentum. The segment measures 15.6 cm in length and has an average circumference of 10.1 cm in exception to the middle of the segment where it is strictured and contains a circumferential mass. The opposing side of the colon displays a firmly adhered portion of stomach, 10.8 x 5.1 cm that displays a Y-shaped staple line. The adherent omentum radiates up to 19.0 cm. (SB20/mlm) Upon opening the segment of colon, there is a 5.6 x 5.0 cm pink-tan circumferential lesion found within the mid portion of the segment. The lesion extends up to 4.5 cm from 1 margin and 6.5 cm from the opposing margin. Sectioning of the lesion reveals an underlying thickness of 3.6 cm with direct gross invasion into the adherent portion of stomach. The lesion extends up to 1.5 cm from the nearest resected margin, serosal invasion is not grossly evident. (SB20/mlm) The remainder of the colon displays pink-tan mucosa with folds arranged in the usual manner. The wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The surrounding serosa and subserosal adipose tissue is mostly grossly unremarkable in exception to an area of puckering that is adjacent to extension of the lesion. (SB20/mlm) The direct extent of the colon lesion into the stomach displays a pink-tan mass, 2.5 cm in greatest dimension. The lesion is approximately 1.0 cm from the nearest stapled Y-shaped margin. The remainder of the gastric mucosa is pink-tan with normal rugae folds. The wall averages 0.3 cm in thickness. (SB20/mlm) Please note there is scant surrounding subserosal adipose tissue. Sectioning of the surrounding adipose tissue reveals a few lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.7 cm up to 0.8 cm. Please note the remainder of the fatty tissue is trimmed away and placed in O-Fixative for further lymph node candidate dissection if needed.

This result is consistent with a competent mismatch repair function. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS).<BR/><BR/>Microsatellite Instability Analysis has multifaceted clinical utility: as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response; as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for colorectal carcinoma; and as a genetic risk biomarker for the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as Lynch Syndrome.<BR/><BR/>As an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy biomarker, recent literature (Le, et al., <i>N Engl J Med</i> 372:2509-2520; Topolian, et al., <i>Nature Reviews Cancer</i> 16:275-287) indicates that, in general, patients that are Microsatellite Stable (MSS) have a poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.<BR/><BR/>MSS tumors have poorer prognosis than MSI-H tumors, and better response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. <BR/><BR/>As a genetic risk biomarker, the result of MSS is inconsistent with Lynch syndrome. However, if the clinical suspicion remains high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result, consideration should be given to a genetic consult to direct additional testing. <BR/><BR/>Interpretation of this result of MSS in the context of other clinical and laboratory findings is strongly recommended.

Appendix 2. Transverse colon and partial stomach\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - There is a 5.6 cm circumferential tumor present in the colon which is adherent and directly extends into attached stomach. The tumor in the stomach is 2.5 cm in greatest dimension and has infiltrated the entire thickness of stomach wall and is protruding into the lumen. Immunohistochemical stains for VIII are used for evaluation of the case and angiolymphatic invasion is not noted. The case is reviewed in consultation with Dr. Melissa Patton, who concurs with the above-rendered diagnosis. Report previously signed on 09/06/2017 is amended to change the diagnosis previously reported as: 1. Appendix, appendectomy:     Appendix with no significant histopathological change.     Negative for malignancy. 2. Transverse colon and partial stomach, transverse colectomy and partial   gastrectomy:     Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of colon directly invading       into stomach (see comment).     Both colonic margins of resection are free of malignancy.     Gastric margins of resection are free of malignancy.     Negative for angiolymphatic invasion.     Lymph node with sinus histiocytosis, no evidence of metastasis, total of       ten lymph nodes examined (0/15).     Focal area of chronic serositis, numerous foamy histiocytes, foreign body giant       cells suggestive of perforation.     Chronic inactive gastritis with prominent lymphoid aggregates.       Immunohistochemical stain and H and E stain are negative for Helicobacter         pylori like organisms.     Pathological TNM stage: pT4b, N0, MX. Report is amended to change the lymph nodes examined in specimen 2 from ten to fifteen. Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist and representative areas of tumor and normal tissue selected. These areas were microdissected from the surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA extracted using standard methods (QIAGEN QIASymphony). The tumor and normal DNA were separately PCR amplified for five microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27; Promega Corp.), and size fractionated via capillary electrophoresis (Life Technologies 3500xl). The tumor and normal profiles were compared to determine the presence of altered microsatellite profiles. The analytic sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10-20% and is dependent on the size and clonality of any instability. The presence of instability in less than 10-20% of the DNA examined will not be detected. This assay uses reagents that may be marked as Research Use Only or Analyte Specific Reagent. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. Portions of this test use reagents designated by the manufacturer as for research use, not for clinical use. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. <BR/><BR/>Klump B,et al. <i>Int J Colorectal Dis</i> Vol 19:23-42, 2004; Grady WM.<i>Cancer Metastasis Rev</i> Vol 23:11-27, 2004; Umar, et al., <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> Vol 96:261-268, 2004; Popat S, Hubner R, Houlston RS. <i>Prognosis J Clin Oncol</i> Vol 23(3):609-618, 2005; Ribic CM, et al.,<i> N Engl J Med.</i> Vol 349(3):247-257, 2003; D.
