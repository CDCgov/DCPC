The skin ellipse is found along the superior aspect and measures 5.2 x 1.5 cm. On the skin surface is an eccentrically located 0.2 cm in greatest dimension possible puncture mark (that approaches medially by approximately 1.9 cm). The margins are inked as follows: Superior blue, inferior green, medial red, lateral yellow, anterior orange, and deep is inked black. Serially sectioning lateral to medial reveals a 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.4 cm pink-tan firm mass with finger-like projections. Adjacent to the mass (approaching superiorly is a hemorrhagic biopsy cavity, 0.8 cm in greatest dimension). Embedded in the biopsy cavity is a cylindrical metallic biopsy clip. The lesion extends up to the nearest deep margin, approximately 4.0 mm from the nearest surfacing skin approaching superior, 5.0 mm from the nearest medial margin, 10.0 mm from the nearest inferior margin, and 16.0 mm from the nearest lateral margin. Summary of sections: 1A-1C, trisected section of lesion containing respective closest margins and surfacing skin, junction between 1A and 1B is inked red, junction between 1B and 1C is inked yellow (1C contains lesion with nearest superior and surfacing skin margin, 1B contains nearest anterior and deep margins, and 1C contains nearest inferior margin), 1/1 each; 1D, nearest medial margin, 4/1; 1E, lateral margin, 2/1; 1F, section of possible scar on surfacing skin with underlying lesion and biopsy cavity, 1/1; 1G, additional section of lesion and respective anterior and deep margins, 1/1.
