Found in the mid aspect of the segment is an exophytic pink-tan polypoid lesion, 6.3 x 4.2 cm. The lesion is partially circumferential and the colon is strictured at this point. Upon sectioning, the lesion extends up to 1.5 cm in thickness and is approximately 5.0 cm from the nearest resected margin. There is also gross extent into the adjacent serosa that displays a portion of adherent cauterized fatty tissue and possible mucosal tissue (this area measures 3.0 x 3.0 x 2.2 cm. The lesion is found to be 3.2 cm from the smaller circumference margin and 5.6 cm from the margin of the largest circumference. The remainder of the colon displays pink-tan mucosa with the folds adjacent to the smaller circumference margin displaying normal folds and the mucosal folds along the side of the larger circumference appearing flattened in appearance. The wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The surrounding serosa and subserosal tissue are otherwise grossly unremarkable in exception to the previously described portion adherent to the lesion. Sectioning of the surrounding fatty tissue reveals multiple pink-tan lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 cm up to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. Please note there is scant surrounding fatty tissue. The lymph nodes were searched for a second time. Summary of sections: 1A, margin from wider circumference, 1/1; 1B, margin from smaller circumference, 1/1; 1C and 1D, full-thickness bisected section of lesion with extent to adherent portion of possible mucosa, junction of the 2 sections inked orange (1C contains colon half, 1D contains serosal half), 1/1 each; 1E-1G, trisected section of mass at deepest invasion with nearest blue inked resected radial margin (junction between 1E and 1F is inked green, junction between 1F and 1G is inked orange), 1/1 each; 1H-1J, sections of lesion with adjacent mucosa, 1/1 each; 1K, fibrous area adjacent to radial resected margin, 2/1; 1L, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1M, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1N, 1 lymph node bisected, 2/1; 1O, 1 lymph node bisected, 2/1; 1P, sections of fatty tissue with adjacent vessels, 4/1.
