Received in formalin labeled \"Huttongallbladder\" is a 9.2 x 2.8 x 2.9 cm disrupted cholecystectomy specimen. The serosa is yellow-green to tan-pink, smooth and displays a focal area of cautery artifact. The specimen is opened to reveal dark green bile and a dark green velvety mucosa. Sectioning through the specimen reveals the wall ranges in thickness 0.5 up to 0.8 cm and the cystic duct is patent. There is one black ovoid gallstone measuring 4.3 x 3.1 x 2.4 cm. Representative sections are submitted in A1. B. The specimen is received in formalin, labeled \"Huttonright colon\" is a segment of small bowel (17.7 cm in length by 4.4 cm in circumference) with attached colon (32.3 cm in length by 12.7 cm in greatest circumference). The serosa is tan-pink, smooth and displays yellow mesentery running the entire length of the specimen and measures up to 9.3 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened along the antimesenteric serosa to reveal a tan-pink mucosa and a 3.2 x 4.2 x 2.4 cm almost circumferential raised lobulated lesion in the ascending colon. The lesion is 8.7 cm from the distal margin, widely free of the proximal margin and 9.3 cm from the mesenteric margin. Sectioning through the specimen reveals the lesion invades into and possibly through the muscularis propria and displays multiple cysts containing mucoid material. The mesentery reveals 23 possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 up to 1.3 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. Section code: B1-proximal margin, B2-distal margin, B3-mesenteric margin, B4-represents section of lesion and adjacent mesentery, B5-additional section of lesion, B6-6 possible lymph nodes, B7-6 possible lymph nodes, B8-6 possible lymph nodes, B9-5 possible lymph nodes.
