The specimen is received fresh with the patient's name \"\" and \"right breast mass excision, short stitch superior, long stitch lateral, double stitch deep and dark suture anteromedial.\" The specimen measures 12.0 cm from medial to lateral x 8.2 cm from superior to inferior x 2.3 cm anterior to posterior. The specimen is inked as follows: superior - blue, inferior - green, anterior - yellow, lateral - red, medial - orange, and deep - black. Partially sectioning through the tissue at 90 degrees to the dark suture reveals non- descript fibrous tissue in the area of the black suture. There is an area of firm tissue noted towards the anterior aspect of the specimen that is ill-defined and measures approximately 4.0 x 5.7 x 2.0 cm. There is another small firm area within the third slice from the more inferior aspect of the specimen measuring approximately 0.7 cm in diameter. The larger firm mass is sampled for intraoperative consultation as 1FSA and later submitted in cassette 1FSA (1/1FSA). The specimen will be further sectioned and evaluated after further fixation. Post fixation: The previously described ill-defined area of firm tissue abuts all the respected margins. Further sectioning reveals the firm area displays smaller pink-tan nodules found within the fibrous firm tissue that is diffusely scattered throughout the specimen. The specimen is submitted as follows: 1A, superior margin with firm tissue, 1/1; 1B, anterior and deep margins, 1/1; 1C, inferior margin, 1/1; 1D, lateral margin, 1/1; 1E, medial margin, 1/1; 1F-J, additional representative sections of firm area with respective margins, 1/1 each.

The opposing side is flattened and is consistent with old margin. The new margin is inked blue and the opposing side is inked green. Serially sectioning perpendicular to the long axis reveals a tan-white rubbery fibrous diffuse cut surface with focal areas of fatty tissue. No definite lesions are grossly identified.
