This measures 17 cm from the base of the cecum to the distal ascending colonic surgical margin. Proximal ileal and distal colonic margin in A, grossly benign and viable. Upon opening, the ileocecal valve appears normal, however, lateral to this is a bisected indurated mass 2.5 x up to partial circumferential 4 cm measurement. It is focally ulcerated and on serial cut section, there is induration of the wall of the colon mass. Multiple full-thickness sections in B, C and D. The serosal surface beneath and deep to the mass lesion is retracted and there is a 0.3-0.5 cm nodule at this level, this representing the radial margin, inked green and full- thickness section in E. Initial dissection of the underlying mesenteric and pericolonic fat is initially negative for enlarged lymph nodes. One small area is identified 0.8 cm, this subserosal fat nodule in F. The specimen is then fixed in Carnoy's solution for additonal pericolonic lymph node dissection. After Carnoy's fixation, the pericolonic lymph nodes are dissected in cassettes H, I and J.

Additional pericolonic lymph node dissection after prolonged Carnoy's fixation: 11 additional pericolonic lymph nodes negative for malignancy.   Final pericolonic lymph node status: 20 pericolonic lymph nodes negative for malignancy. Therefore the final TNM classification is pT2 pN0 pMx. Micro: The 9 lymph nodes initially identified from the pericolonic fat dissection are negative for metastatic carcinoma. After prolonged Carnoy's fixation, additional pericolonic lymph node dissection is in process and a final report will follow. Additional Gross: After prolonged Carnoy's fixation, additional pericolonic lymph nodes are dissected in cassettes K-N. ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.microscopic examination\n\nThe right hemicolectomy shows negative proximal ileal and distal colonic surgical margins. The radial margin is negative for invasive malignancy by 0.2 cm. This corresponds to the area of retracted/nodular serosa. An invasive poorly differentiated mucinous type of adenocarcinoma arises in a dysplastic tubulovillous adenoma in the cecum. There is direct invasion of the muscularis propria externa but no evidence of subserosal invasion. However, lymphatic invasion is identified focally within the wall of the colon. Although there is a cribriform pattern of malignant gland infiltration, there is about 75% of the tumor forming mucinous pattern of invasion. At the base of the invasive tumor in the muscularis propria there is a definite \"Crohn's like\" inflammatory reaction consisting of clusters of hyperplastic lymphoid cells, increased fibrosis. Therefore, this is a primary pT2 tumor. The pericolonic lymph node dissection after Carnoy's fixation is in process and a supplemental report will follow.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nRight hemicolectomy\n\n\n"
