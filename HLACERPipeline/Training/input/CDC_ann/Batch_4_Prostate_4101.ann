Received in fixative labeled \"\" and \"preprostatic fat\" is a 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.2 cm piece of soft, yellow-tan to brown lobulated adipose tissue. No discrete lesions or definite lymph nodes are identified on the cut surface. Representative sections are submitted in cassette 1A, M/1. 2. Received in fixative labeled \"\" and \"prostate\" is a 49 g prostate gland (5.0 x 4.5 x 4.0 cm) with 2 detached pieces of apparent seminal vesicles (1.2 and 1.5 cm in length). The external surface of the prostate gland is pink-tan to brown and granular with focal cautery artifact. No definite seminal vesicles or vasa deferentia are identified on the prostate gland. The right side of the specimen is marked with red ink and the left side is marked with blue ink. Serially sectioning the prostate reveals a glistening, gray-tan, multicystic cut surface. There are numerous brown calculi (0.1 to 0.3 cm in maximum dimension) identified within the cysts. There is a poorly circumscribed, poorly demarcated pale tan discoloration (3.4 x 2.2 cm) surrounding the urethral orifice and extending from the apex to the base. No other gross abnormalities are identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 2A, apical margin, 4/1; 2B, bladder neck margin, 4/1; 2C, the larger detached seminal vesicle, 3/1; 2D, the smaller detached seminal vesicle, 2/1; 2E-2M, right prostate from apex to base, 1/1 each; 2N-2V, left prostate from apex to base, 1/1 each.

Prostate, radical prostatectomy:     Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+4=7 (Grade Group 2).     Tumor focally involves the apical margin.     The tumors are organ-confined, but extraprostatic extension cannot be evaluated       in areas of positive margin.     The seminal vesicles are negative for tumor.

Prostate\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - Dominant nodule: Gleason score 3+4=7 with <5% pattern 4, localized anteriorly involving both sides of the prostate centered in the apex/mid. Secondary nodule: Gleason score 3+4=7 with <5% pattern 4, localized on the right posterolaterally in the apex/mid. Margins: One of the tumor nodules involves a cauterized surface on the apical margin. The overall summed length of positive margins is approximately 1 mm. Multiple additionally H and E levels are examined in this focus. The highest grade at the margin is Gleason grade 3. Tumor Extent: The tumors are organ-confined, but extraprostatic extension cannot be evaluated in areas of positive margin. The seminal vesicles are negative for tumor. Definitive lymphatic invasion is not identified. Overall, the tumors involve approximately 30% of the prostatic volume. Gleason scores can be grouped and range from Grade Group 1 (most favorable) to Grade Group 5 (least favorable).\n\n\n"
