The capsular surface displays a firm white-tan suspicious area measuring 1.5 cm in greatest dimension with adherent pink-tan rubbery tissue measuring 3.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm. The rubbery tissue displays an attached stapled margin which is removed and inked orange. The capsular surfaces are inked black and the margins are inked blue. Serially sectioning the specimen reveals a firm white-tan lesion corresponding to the surface discoloration, measuring 2.6 x 2.0 x 1.1 cm. The suspicious tissue extends through the capsular surface and invades into the attached portion of pink-tan rubbery tissue with a stapled margin. The suspicious tissue focally measures 0.5 cm from the stapled margin and focally measures 1.4 cm from the closest portion of the hepatic margin. No additional lesions are identified. The remaining parenchyma is dark tan and spongy throughout. The entire lesion is submitted in cassettes 1A-E, with 1A-E including the adherent soft tissue with a stapled margin marked with orange ink and 1E including the closest portion of the hepatic margin inked blue.
