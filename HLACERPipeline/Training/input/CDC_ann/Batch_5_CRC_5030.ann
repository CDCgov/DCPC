Block 1A is not here, having previously been sent to \nclinical trials. The immunohistochemistry was ordered on block 2A. There is no internal \ncontrol in this block but the provided external positive control is working. \n \nBy immunohistochemistry the tumor cells show normal protein expression for hMLH1, hMSH2, \nhMSH6 and PMS2. I have shown the immunohistochemical slides and the previous H E stained \nslides to Dr. X, who agrees that the expression for all 4 markers is normal. \n \nThese results are indicative of normal DNA mismatch repair function within the tumor (the \ntumor is microsatellite stable). Thus, the likelihood that this individual has an inherited \ncolon cancer syndrome (e.g. HNPCC) due to defective DNA mismatch repair is very low. \nAlthough less likely, we cannot rule out the possibility of an abnormality in the other \ngenes involved in DNA mismatch repair. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility the \ntumor in this individual is due to an inherited defect in another gene not involved in \nmismatch repair. \n \nThe results should be interpreted in context of clinical findings, family history and other \nlaboratory data. If results obtained do not match the clinical findings, additional testing \nshould be considered. \n \n---- Surgical Pathology Addendum Diagnosis: \n \nBy immunohistochemistry the tumor cells show NORMAL protein expression for hMLH1, hMSH2, \nhMSH6 and PMS2. \n\n\n\nPath report.gross description\n\n1.

There are fragments of colonic mucosa in which there is invasive adenocarcinoma that, in\nthis material, appears low grade. There appears to be some background adenomatous change in\none of the fragments where there is also a small amount of non-neoplastic mucosa visible. \n \nIn accordance with the Quality Assurance Program in the Department of Pathology at the \nHOSPITAL 10, selected slides have been reviewed by a second pathologist, Dr.\nX, who agrees with the diagnosis of malignancy. \n \n2. There are fragments of colonic mucosa that are variably oriented and in which there are \nadenomatous changes including high-grade dysplasia. There is stromal fibroplasia and some \nerosion of the surface. There is at least high-grade dysplasia and the changes are \nsuspicious for invasive adenocarcinoma but I cannot make a definite diagnosis of the latter \nin this specimen.
