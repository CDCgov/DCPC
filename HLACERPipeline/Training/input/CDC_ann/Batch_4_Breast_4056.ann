The remaining fluid is filtered, yielding an aggregate of 3.0 x 0.7 x 0.1 cm containing tan-brown core biopsies with attached coagulated blood. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes 1A-1B. 1A, 5/1; 1B, M/1.\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - Left breast lesion\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\nBreast, left, 12-o'clock, Mammotome core biopsy:     Invasive mammary carcinoma, no special type (ductal), high combined histologic       grade with high proliferative rate.     Tumor involves multiple cores and measures up to 1.4 cm in greatest span.     High-grade in-situ component present.     See comment.\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nHormone Receptor report: Neoplastic cells are positive for nuclear estrogen and progesterone receptor expression.

Ruthie in Dr. 's office was notified of the diagnosis at 3:52 p.m. CST on 8/10/17. FISH Comments - The FISH assay revealed an equivocal amplification of the HER-2 gene compared with the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP17). The average ratio of 1.32 and Her2 copy number of 4.58 is calculated from the initial and repeat evaluations by 2 independent observers. Results less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates equivocal. Per the 2013 ASCO/CAP guidelines equivocal Her2 results must be assessed by another test; IHC Her2 testing has been performed and reported separately.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
