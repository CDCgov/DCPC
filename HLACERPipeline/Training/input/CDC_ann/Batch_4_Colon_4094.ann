Received in formalin in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"right colon\" is a right colon including cecum which is 17.2 cm in length and varies in circumference from 5 cm near the ileocecal valve, 9 cm in the cecum and 10.5 cm near the distal margin. Attached to the cecum is a 10.5 cm long portion of terminal ileum with a diameter varying from 4.5 to 8 cm. The margins of resection are closed with multiple staples. The mucosa of the colon is tan, velvety with the transverse fold pattern prominent. Approximately 5.5 cm from the ileocecal valve is a 0.5 cm polypoid excrescence. The mucosa at the appendiceal os contains a 3 x 1 cm endophytic yellow-tan and red mass. The mass appears to extend into the muscularis and is within 0.2 cm of the inked serosa. The appendix is 3 cm in length and up to 2 cm in diameter. The tip of the appendix is not clearly visualized. Approximately 3 cm from the probable appendix the serosa of the small bowel has a nodular tan and red-brown appearance in an area 4 x 2.5 cm. The small bowel mucosa is tan to light green, velvety and arranged in transverse folds. The peritoneum of the small bowel mesentery and the mesocolon is studded with tan nodules 0.2 up to 1.4 cm. Dissected from the mesocolon and mesentery are multiple tan lymph nodes 0.5 to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. Attached by mesentery adjacent to the terminal ileum is an additional segment of small bowel 21 cm in length with a circumference varying from 8.5 to 10 cm. The margins of resection are closed with multiple staples. The serosa at 1 margin is marked with blue ink. The mucosa is pink-tan and has a focally edematous appearance. Discrete lesions, however, are not observed. A serosa and the mesentery of this bowel segment is also studded with similar nodules as described previously. Cassette summary:   1A, en face sections of margins of resection of right colon and attached terminal ileum.   1B, section of cecal mass and uninvolved colonic mucosa.   1C and 1D, sections of mass at appendiceal os.   1E-1F, additional sections of probable appendix.   1G-1H, sections of terminal ileum with granular nodularity of the serosa.   1I, polypoid excrescence in cecum.   1J, sections of nodules attached to serosa of colon and small bowel.   1K-1Q, 1 candidate lymph node each, bisected.   1R, 7 candidate lymph nodes submitted whole.   1S, en face sections of 2nd small bowel segment.   1T, sections of edematous mucosa from the 2nd small bowel segment.
