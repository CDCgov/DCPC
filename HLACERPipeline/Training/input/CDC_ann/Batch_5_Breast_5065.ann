Right breast specimen, Central Health - James Paton Memorial HOSPITAL NL, JPS 1153-16:\n- Focal invasive carcinoma favour invasive lobular carcinoma within spindle cell lesion consistent with myofibroblastoma - see comment\n\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHOSPITAL: see report\nSpecimen #: see report\nSpecimen Procedure Date: see report\nSpecimen Type: see report\nReason for Request: Personal Consult \n\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nReceived for consultation are selected slides and a tissue block of a right breast specimen received in the original pathology department 11/04/16 - per the original pathology report.\nDetails of the material received are in the slide / block description section below.\nA core biopsy of the same lesion (JPS - 50-16) was previously reviewed at HOSPITAL as HOSPITAL S16-8087 - slides of this were also received.\n\nIn the material reviewed of JPS 1153-16 a spindle cell lesion is present in slides A24 and A26 and focally A29. This is circumscribed but not encapsulated and is composed of spindle to oval cells forming short fascicles with intervening collagen and with scattered lymphocytes. The nuclei of this are bland, only very occasional mitoses are identified ( a maximum of 1 per single high power field and 2 per 10 high power field - however please note it is not possible to tell if the mitoses are in the spindle cell lesion or the invasive carcinoma - see below). No confluent necrosis is present. There are scattered fat cells within the lesion and occasional breast ducts are within the lesion - mainly towards the periphery. No classic slits of pseudoangiomatous hyperplasia are present.\n\nIn the immunostains performed at HOSPITAL the spindle cells are diffusely positive with vimentin, CD34, BCL2, and ER, and positive in areas with Desmin, SMMS, Calponin, SMA. The spindle cells are negative with S100, P63, CD45 and nuclear B catenin. The spindle cells are negative with keratins CAM5.2, AE1/AE3, and HMWK ( see invasive carcinoma below). \n\nThe overall features of the spindle cell lesion are consistent with the entity myofibroblastoma.\n\nFocally within the lesion and towards the periphery of it there is an atypical solid epithelial proliferation within occasional small ducts composed of monotonous non high grade cells which are positive with ER and HMWK with lack of membrane staining with E cadherin indicative of in situ lobular carcinoma.\nNot identifiable in H\\T\\E stained slides but evident in the CAM5.2, AE1/AE3, and HMWK stained slides there is focal invasive carcinoma characterized by either individual cells or cells in short single file infiltrating the myofibroblastoma in the vicinity of the in situ lobular carcinoma. I cannot identify these cells in the H\\T\\E stained slide or immunostains other than keratins thus cannot assess the E cadherin or ER staining properties of them, however in view of the appearance of the cells in the keratin stained slides in context with in situ lobular carcinoma I favour this is invasive lobular carcinoma. This measures approximately 4.5mm maximum dimension in section A26. Invasive carcinoma is not seen outside the spindle cell lesion in section A26.\n\nOnly tissue block A26 was received thus immunostaining has only been performed on that block. I do not identify invasive carcinoma or LCIS in the other slides of breast tissue received in which there is columnar cell change and hyperplasia focally suggestive of flat epithelial atypia / atypical ductal hyperplasia. Two of the slides received contain lymphoid tissue consistent with/ suggestive of small lymph nodes - no metastatic carcinoma is identified.\n\nThe diagnoses of both invasive carcinoma and of spindle cell lesion consistent with myofibroblastoma are confirmed at intradepartmental consultation.\nOn review of the core biopsy I do not identify invasive carcinoma in the slides.\n\nIn view of the subtle nature of the invasive carcinoma - immunostaining of selected additional sections of breast tissue and of lymph nodes may be considered in order to identify invasive carcinoma / metastatic carcinoma that may be difficult to identify on routine stain.\n\n(The diagnosis was discussed with the referring pathologist on the telephone on May 3 2016). \n\n\n\n\n\n"
