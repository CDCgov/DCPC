However, there is no unequivocal evidence of a low grade\nlymphoma component.\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nThe patient is a 30-year-old male with a colonic mass. The primary pathologist has\nrequested consultation for confirmation of diagnosis.\n \nThe findings are as described by the primary pathologist. The sections show a diffuse\npolymorphous infiltrate consisting of atypical small to large cells and many mixed\ninflammatory cells. This process involves the entire thickness of the bowel wall.\nThere is an area of adjacent mucosal ulceration and perforation. \n \nBy immunohistochemistry, there are sheets and isolated cells of neoplastic B-cells\nthat stain positive for CD20, CD79a, MUM1, BCL-6, BCL-2 (patchy faint positive),\nPAX5, and IgD. These cells are negative for EBV, HHV8, cyclin-D1, CD5, CD43, CD23,\nCD10, and ALK1. Reactive T cells stain positive for CD3, CD5, and CD43. Plasma cells\nare positive for CD138, CD79a, MUM1, and negative for CD56. The proliferation index,\nas measured by Ki-67 labeling, is estimated at 70%.\n \nThe morphologic and immunophenotypic findings favour a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\nof activated B-cell type.\n\n\n"
