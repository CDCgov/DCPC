NEOPLASTIC CELLS ARE NEGATIVE FOR NUCLEAR PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR. NEOPLASTIC CELLS SHOW EQUIVOCAL IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE OF HER2 OVEREXPRESSION. HER-2 status will be confirmed on FISH.\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nFISH Comments - The FISH assay revealed an equivocal amplification of the HER-2 gene compared with the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP17). The average ratio of 1.94 and Her2 copy number of 4.48 is calculated from the initial and repeat evaluations by 2 independent observers. Results less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates equivocal. Per the 2013 ASCO/CAP guidelines equivocal Her2 results must be assessed by another test; IHC Her2 testing has been performed and reported separately.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nFish Report: FISH - EQUIVOCAL for HER-2 oncogene amplification by FISH analysis     ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - Invasive mammary carcinoma, no special type (ductal)\n\n\n"
