This case will be referred to hematopathology service\nat HOSPITAL for further evaluation.\n\n\nGROSS PATHOLOGY\n\nThe specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and\nas \"biopsy ascending colon mass\". The specimen consists of multiple fragments of\ntan-gray, soft tissue ranging in size from 0.2 cm up to 0.4 cm, submitted in toto in\nA1.                                  /LS\n\n\nADDENDUMS\n\nHistologic sections of colon reveal a densely cellular, abnormal lymphoproliferation\ninvolving the lamina propria of multiple fragments with focal necrosis. Included is\na marked predominance of cells of intermediate to large size. These have rounded to\nmildly irregular nuclear contours, coarsely vesicular chromatin, one or more\ndiscernible, eosinophilic nucleoli and poorly circumscribed cytoplasmic borders.\nAdmixed apoptotic cells are abundant, imparting a so-called \"starry sky\" appearance\nat low magnification, an indication of high cell turnover. Admixed small\nlymphocytes are rare.\nBy immunohistochemistry, the lymphoproliferation is of B immunophenotype: CD20+,\nCD10-, Bcl6+, Bcl2+ (strong), CD5-, cyclin D1-, Tdt-.\n\nADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS\nASCENDING COLON, BIOPSY:\n   - AGGRESSIVE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, AWAITING FURTHER CHARACTERIZATION (SEE COMMENT).\n\nComment: The differential diagnosis includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)\nas well as a B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between\nDLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Given these findings, interphase FISH for MYC,\nBcl2 and Bcl6 rearrangements will be pursued. Both cytologic features and the\nimmunophenotype (CD10-, strong Bcl2+) argue against BL. The absence of Tdt\nexpression argues against the diagnosis of lymphoblastic lymphoma. A further\naddendum will be issued following completion of FISH studies.\nInterphase FISH analysis was performed. Neither MYC nor BCL6 rearrangements could\nbe demonstrated. Furthermore, IgH-BCL2 fusion was inapparent. However, a pattern\nconsistent with three copies of the BCL2 locus characterized a proportion of nuclei\nexamined. As noted by the cytogeneticist, this could reflect partial or complete\ntrisomy 18 or a BCL2 rearrangement involving a partner other than IgH. Additional\nimmunohistochemical stains were also performed. CD34 expression was absent. A high\nproportion of tumour cells expressed the proliferation marker Ki67 (80-90%).\nCollectively, these findings do not allow for further subclassification of this\nlesion.\n\nADDENDUM DIAGNOSIS\nASCENDING COLON, BIOPSY:\n   - AGGRESSIVE B-CELL LYMPHOMA; INTERPHASE FISH NEGATIVE FOR MYC OR BCL6\n    REARRANGEMENTS OR IgH-BLC2.\nRESULT\nnuc ish (MYCx)[200],(IGHx2,BCL2x3)[46/200],(BCL6x2)[200]\nThis is an ABNORMAL molecular cytogenetic result.\nScreen       Probe     Pattern\nBCL6 Rearrangement BCL6 BAR    Normal\nMYC Rearrangement  MYC BAR    Normal\nt(14;18)      IGH, BCL2   BCL2 gain\nNuclear fluorescence in situ hybridization (nuc ISH) was used to screen this\nspecimen for rearrangements involving the following genes: BCL6, MYC, IGH and BCL2.\nA pattern consistent with 3 copies of the BCL2 locus was detected in 23% of nuclei\nexamined. However, fusion of IGH with BCL2 was NOT detected. The BCL2 pattern may\nrepresent partial or complete trisomy of chromosome 18, or a BCL2 rearrangement with\na fusion pattern other than IGH. Gain of the BCL2 locus is of uncertain clinical\nsignificance.\nClinical and hematopathological correlation are suggested.\nThis report is dependent upon the accuracy of the referring diagnosis. Rare\ndiagnostic errors may occur. Cryptic rearrangements, low level mosaicism and\nnon-chromosomal genetic diseases are not usually detectable by this test.\nSelvarajah, Shamini PhD, FACMG.
