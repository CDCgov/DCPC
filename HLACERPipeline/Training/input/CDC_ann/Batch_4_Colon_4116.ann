Positive for monosomy of chromosome 17.  - Negative for MET gene amplification.\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nFISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed no evidence of HER2 (17q12) gene amplification. The HER2/CEP17 ratio was 1.01. However, deletion of HER2 and CEP17 (centromere 17) were detected in 56% of cells analyzed, indicating monosomy of chromosome 17. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.    Monitoring for this anomaly may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.   FISH revealed no evidence of MET (7q31.2) gene amplification. However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  CEP7/MET (Centromere 7/7q31) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  CEP17/HER2 (Centromere 17/17q12) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)   References:  Nat Med. 2012 Feb 12;18(3):382-4; Oncol Rep. 2012 Oct;28(4):1187-92; J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1667-74.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist and representative areas of tumor and normal tissue selected. These areas were microdissected from the surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA extracted using standard methods (QIAGEN QIASymphony). The tumor and normal DNA were separately PCR amplified for five microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27; Promega Corp.), and size fractionated via capillary electrophoresis (Life Technologies 3500xl). The tumor and normal profiles were compared to determine the presence of altered microsatellite profiles. The analytic sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10-20% and is dependent on the size and clonality of any instability. The presence of instability in less than 10-20% of the DNA examined will not be detected. This assay uses reagents that may be marked as Research Use Only or Analyte Specific Reagent.

This result is consistent with a competent mismatch repair function. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS).<BR/><BR/>Microsatellite Instability Analysis has multifaceted clinical utility: as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response; as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for colorectal carcinoma; and as a genetic risk biomarker for the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as Lynch Syndrome.<BR/><BR/>As an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy biomarker, recent literature (Le, et al., <i>N Engl J Med</i> 372:2509-2520; Topolian, et al., <i>Nature Reviews Cancer</i> 16:275-287) indicates that, in general, patients that are Microsatellite Stable (MSS) have a poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.<BR/><BR/>MSS tumors have poorer prognosis than MSI-H tumors, and better response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. <BR/><BR/>As a genetic risk biomarker, the result of MSS is inconsistent with Lynch syndrome. However, if the clinical suspicion remains high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result, consideration should be given to a genetic consult to direct additional testing. <BR/><BR/>Interpretation of this result of MSS in the context of other clinical and laboratory findings is strongly recommended.
