A negative result does not rule out the presence of a myeloproliferative disorder that does not carry the <i>JAK2</i> V617F mutation or the presence of a low-level clonal population of V617F mutant cells below the limit of detection of this assay. This mutation has been reported in nearly all cases of polycythemia vera (PV) cases, and in 25% - 60% of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). This point mutation may be found in other myeloid malignancies. A mutant allele of >50% indicates homozygosity for the <i>JAK2</i> V617F mutation, and is reported in many patients with PV or PMF, but not in ET. Quantitation of the <i>JAK2</i> V617F mutation is important in monitoring the malignant clone and assessing response to therapy. Final interpretation requires correlation with other clinical and hematologic findings. JAK2 V617F Mutation Detection and Quantitation/Specimen Type: Peripheral Blood\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nMolec Comments - <i>JAK2</i> V617F mutation detection was performed using a real-time allele-specific PCR assay (IPSOGEN). This assay detects and quantifies the <i>JAK2</i> V617F mutation from wild-type sequences using standard calibration curves, from which the percentage of <i>JAK2</i> V617F positive DNA in the specimen is calculated. The limit of detection (LOD) of this assay is approximately 30-40 copies of the <i>JAK2</i> V617F allele, which corresponds in most specimens to approximately 0.2% mutant. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) of this assay is approximately 100 copies of the <i>JAK2</i> V617F allele, which correspond in most specimens to approximately 0.5% mutant. Specimens that have <i>JAK2</i> V617F copy number between the LOD and LOQ will be reported as \"\"Detected, /<LOQ\"\". A value of >50% mutant allele indicates homozygosity of the mutant clone for the <i>JAK2</i> mutation. This assay is highly accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Associated Pathologists d/b/a PathGroup. It has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. The laboratory is regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 as qualified to perform high complexity clinical testing. <BR/><BR/>Kralovics R, et al, <i>N Engl J Med</i> Vol 352:1779-1790, 2005; Tefferi A, <i>Curr Hematol Malig Rep</i> Vol 1(2):81-86, 2006; Kiladjian JJ, <i>Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book</i> Vol 35: e389-396, 2015; Langabeer SE, et al, <i>Eur J Haematol</i> doi: 10.1111/ejh.12578, 2015; Cetin G, et al, <i>Mol Biol Rep</i> Vol 41(10):6737-6742, 2014; Viny AD and Levine RL, <i>Cancer J</i> Vol 20(1):61-65, 2014.\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - Malig neoplm of upper-inner quadrant of right female breast (C50.211)\n\n\n"
