These molecular test results should be correlated with other findings.\nSUMMARY OF TECHNICAL DETAILS\nAssay: DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissue and\nscreened for 29 different EGFR gene mutations using a real-time PCR assay\n(EntroGen EGFR Mutation Analysis Kit) [3].\nEGFR Mutation Panel:\nExon 18: G719S (c.2155G>A), G719C (c.2155G>T), G719A (c.2156G>C)\nExon 19: 19 different deletions and complex mutations (all in-frame)\nExon 20: S768I (c.2303G>T), T790M (c.2369C>T), A767_V769dup (c.2299_2307dup),\np.His773dup (c.2317_2319dup), p.Asp770_Asn771insGly (c.2310_2311insGGT)\nExon 21: L858R (c.2573T>G), L861Q (c.2582T>A)\nReference sequence: NM_005228.3\nLimitations: This test is limited to the 29 EGFR mutations listed above, and will\nnot detect other EGFR mutations. This assay cannot detect mutations\noccurring at frequencies less than the demonstrated limit of\ndetection (LOD), which is estimated to be less than 5%.\nThis assay detects 19 different deletions and complex mutations of exon 19, but does\nnot distinguish between them. This assay detects 3 different missense mutations\ninvolving codon 719 (G719S, G719C, G719A), but does not distinguish between them.\nThe assay detects the c.2317_2319dup and c.2310_2311insGGT mutations of exon 20, but\ndoes not distinguish between them.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Nat Rev Cancer 2007;7:169-181 (PMID 17318210)\n[2] Oncogene 2009;28:S24-S31 (PMID 19680293)\n[3] Oncol Rep 2013;30:1045-1052 (PMID 23817662)\nDr. Brenda Murphy, PhD, FCCMG (Molecular)\nAccession #: 15:MO5807\nHOSPITAL Regional HOSPITAL\n1200 Main St. W. - Room 3N20\nHOSPITAL, ON\nL8S 4J9\n905-521-5085\nTHIS IS A CORRECTED REPORT\nLEFT UPPER LUNG LOBE\n   -  EGFR MUTATION NEGATIVE, ALK RE-ARRANGEMENT, REFER TO SYNOPTIC REPORT\nTest performed on Spec #: S15-29493\nAdequacy of Sample for Testing: Adequate\nEstimated % Tumor Cellularity: 20\nRefer to Molecular Oncology Report: 15: MO5807\nEGFR Mutational Analysis: No mutation detected, wild-type EGFR allele\nEGFR Exons Assessed: 18  19 20 21\nEGFR Mutational Analysis Testing Method(s):\nReal-time PCR\n   EntroGen EGFR Mutation Analysis Kit Exons 18-21\nALK Rearrangement: No rearrangement detected\nALK Rearrangement Testing Method(s):\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC)\nIHC Method: 5A4 antibody using Leica Bond Refine detection system\nDr. J.
