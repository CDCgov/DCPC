Dr. Fred Kretzschmar has\n reviewed these slides and concurs with the diagnosis of\n reactive/negative for malignancy. Calretinin stain and MOC31 confirm\n these diagnostic impressions. EpCam marker BerEP4 highlights a rare\n cluster of immunoreactive cells without a morphologic correlate on H and E.\n No overt cytologic malignant features are noted on cytology and\n appearances of the rare cluster of cells are favored to be artifactual\n in nature.\n\n The immunohistochemistry stain(s) reported above were developed and\n their performance characteristics determined by Marin Medical\n Laboratories. They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food\n and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or\n approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It\n should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This\n laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement\n Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity\n clinical laboratory testing. Control stains are verified and function\n normally.\n\n\n"
