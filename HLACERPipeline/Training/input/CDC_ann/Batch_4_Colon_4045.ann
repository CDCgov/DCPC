There is up to 6 cm of attached yellow-red fat. The serosa is tan-pink and smooth. Opening reveals a red bosselated mass. The mass is 7.0 x 4.0 x 3.2 cm. It is located 3.0 cm from the nearest margin which will be arbitrarily designated as margin #1, 4.0 cm from margin #2 and 9.0 cm from the mesenteric margin. The fat and soft tissue below the mass are inked blue. Sectioning through the mass reveals fleshy pink- white firm cut surfaces. The mass does appear grossly superficial and does not show any underlying invasion. Remaining mucosa is pink with flattened folds. The fat is examined for lymph nodes. Also present in the specimen jar are 2 circular tan portions of mucosa which average 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm. Summary of sections: 1A is representative en face margin #1, 1/1; 1B, representative en face margin #2; 1C, en face mesenteric margin to include a trisected lymph node identified at this margin, C is 3/1; D, is sectioned separately received portions of mucosa, 2/1; E-I, is inked blue representative sections through the mass, 1/1 each of those cassettes; J, is multiple possible intact lymph nodes, M/1; K is 2 bisected lymph nodes, 1 of these lymph nodes is inked blue, 4/1; L, multiple intact lymph nodes, M/1; M, is 1 bisected lymph node, 2/1; N, is 1 trisected lymph node which is not inked and 1 bisected lymph node which is inked blue, 5/1; O is 1 trisected lymph node, 3/1.
