Received in formalin labeled \"\" and \"left mastectomy - partial, 2 short superior, 2 long lateral\" is a portion of fatty breast tissue with orienting sutures (per container 2 short is superior and 2 long is lateral) and measures 6.6 cm medial to lateral, 5.2 cm superficial to deep, and 1.8 cm superior to inferior. Protruding from the superficial approaching lateral is a localization wire. The margins are inked as follows: superior-blue, inferior-green, superficial-orange, deep-black, lateral-yellow and medial-red. Serially sectioning medial to lateral reveals a biopsy cavity with an adjacent gritty tan-white area measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm and contains a tightly embedded metallic biopsy clip. This areas appears to abut the nearest superficial margin, 5 mm from the nearest superior and inferior margins, 15 mm from the nearest lateral margin, and greater than 3.0 cm from the remaining margins. The remainder of the specimen is comprised of lobulated fatty breast tissue with focal areas of tan-white fibrous septations. No secondary lesions are grossly identified. Summary of sections: 1A, section containing biopsy clip with nearest superficial, superior and inferior margins, 1/1; 1B, the remainder bisected section adjacent to 1A containing nearest deep margin, 1/1; 1C, lateral margin, 2/1; 1D, medial margin, 1/1; 1E-1G, remainder of biopsy cavity, 1/1 each; 1H, section adjacent to biopsy cavity approaching medial aspect, 1/1. 2. Received in formalin labeled \"\" and \"lateral margin with clip mark as margin\" is a 4.0 x 3.2 x 1.5 cm portion of fatty tissue containing 3 metallic clips (per container, this marks the new lateral margin). The new margin is inked green and the opposing side (old margin) is inked black. Serially sectioning reveals a lobulated fatty cut surface. No suspicious masses or firm areas are identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes 2A-2G, 1/1 each. 3. Received in formalin labeled \"\" and \"new anterior margin clip mark as margin\" is a 3.4 x 2.2 x 0.6 cm portion of fatty tissue containing 3 clips along 1 side (per container this marks the new margin). The new margin is inked green and the opposing side (the old margin) is inked black. Serially sectioning reveals a yellow lobulated cut surface. No masses or lesions are grossly identified. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassettes 3A-3C; 3A and 3B, 3/1 in each; 3C, 2/1.

Breast, left, needle localization partial mastectomy:     Intermediate to high grade ductal carcinoma in situ, solid type with focal central       calcifications, negative for invasive carcinoma.     Ductal carcinoma in situ involves the superficial and superior inked margins of       excision. 2. Breast, left, lateral margin, excision:     Incidental invasive mammary carcinoma, no special type (ductal), 5 mm in       greatest extent, intermediate combined histologic grade, no lymphovascular       invasion identified; new lateral margin negative for malignancy (4 mm).     Residual intermediate to high grade ductal carcinoma in situ, solid and cribriform       type with focal central necrosis, margins negative (nearest margin is new       lateral, <0.5 mm).     See comment. 3. Breast, left, new anterior margin, excision:     Benign breast parenchyma.

The control slides stain appropriately. 80% of the invasive carcinoma shows 2+ nuclear positivity for estrogen receptor. 30% of the tumor shows 2+ nuclear positivity for progesterone receptor. There is strong (3+) membranous expression of HER2 in at least 90% of the cells. Confirmatory HER2 FISH studies will be performed and reported separately. Impression: Breast, left, lateral margin, excision:   NEOPLASTIC CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR NUCLEAR ESTROGEN     RECEPTOR.   NEOPLASTIC CELLS ARE POSITIVE FOR NUCLEAR PROGESTERONE     RECEPTOR.   NEOPLASTIC CELLS SHOW STRONG (3+) IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL     EVIDENCE OF HER2 OVEREXPRESSION.   Confirmatory HER2 FISH studies will be performed and reported     separately.  ## End of auxiliary report ## Fish Report: FISH - POSITIVE for HER-2 oncogene amplification by FISH analysis    ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.microscopic examination\n\nMicroscopic examination is performed. The focus of invasive carcinoma in source #2 (block 2F) is evaluated with immunohistochemical studies utilizing antibodies against p63 and CD10, with appropriate controls. Both demonstrate loss of myoepithelial cells, supporting the diagnosis.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\n1. Left partial mastectomy- 2 shaft superior, 2 long lateral (breast center) 2. Lateral margin with clip mark as margin (perm) 3. New anterior margin with clip mark as margin (perm)\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - Receptor studies will be performed, see separate report for results. FISH Comments - The HER-2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) revealed amplification of the HER-2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 14.46 and a Her2 copy number of 39.32, (ratio greater or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number >6) indicating amplification.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
