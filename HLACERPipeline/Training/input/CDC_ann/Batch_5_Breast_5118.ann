The specimen consists of six cores\nand multiple fragments of grey-white, soft tissue. The cores measure 1.0 cm to\n1.6 cm in length and are submitted in toto in cassettes A1 to A3, two cores in each\ncassette. The multiple fragments range from 0.2 cm to 0.4 cm in length. All tissue\nis filtered and submitted in cassette A4.                    /PB\n\n\nTISSUE SUBMITTED\n\nBREAST BIOPSY (CORE LEFT BREAST BIOPSY)\n\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS\n\nLEFT BREAST CORE BIOPSY:\n   - POSITIVE FOR INVASIVE MAMMARY DUCTAL CARCINOMA.\nComment: All the biopsies reveal invasive carcinoma with focal glandular\nconfiguration.
