Steltzer.\nWhile the changes identified within the specimen are strongly favour to\nrepresent adenocarcinoma the features do show some overlap with reactive\nchanges and as such the opinion of an external expert consultant will be sought\nin this case - when that opinion is available, it will be provided in an\nAddendum Report to follow.\nSee concurrent cytology (C1449-16) and (C1450-16).\nSPECIMEN ADEQUACY AND/ OR MICROSCOPIC FINDINGS\nFavour malignant cells are present.\nA Grocott methenamine silver stain does not demonstrate the presence of\nPneumocystis organisms, nor other fungal elements. A control slide stains\nappropriately.\nThis case was reviewed by a second Cytotechnologist, who agreed with the\noriginal screener's diagnosis - above.\n(As part of the PRHC's Department of Laboratory Medicine's Quality Assurance\nProgram, part or all of this case has been reviewed by one or more pathologists\nin the Department here at the PRHC.
