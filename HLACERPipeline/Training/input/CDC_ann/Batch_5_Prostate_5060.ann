This material was sent for review at the request of Dr. Elaine Boutell.\n\n\n\nPath report.microscopic observation\n\nA. GGH G2644-16 (LYMPH NODE - NECK BX LEFT): All 3 submitted H\\T\\E stained slides and immunostained slides from HOSPITAL 9 are examined. Sections show core biopsy fragments of fibroadipose tissue extensively involved by a malignant neoplasm with surrounding desmoplastic stroma. The tumor comprises of crowded nests and sheets of large malignant cells with moderate amphophilic cytoplasm, pleomorphic hyperchromatic to vesicular nuclei with nucleoli. Areas of comedo-type tumor necrosis are also seen along with scattered apoptotic cells and mitotic figures. The morphological features are consistent with a poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.\n\nImmunostains performed at HOSPITAL 9 show the tumor cells as positive for CAM 5.2 with patchy weak to moderate staining for Synaptophysin. The tumor cells are negative for Chromogranin, High molecular weight keratin, CK5/6, p63, CK 7, CK 20, CDX2, TTF-1, PSA, S100, and HMB-45. \n\nAdditional stains performed at Grand River HOSPITAL on block 3 show the tumor cells as positive for AE1/AE3 with patchy weak to moderate staining for Synaptophysin and focal weak staining for PSAP. The tumor cells are negative for Chromogranin, CD56, and PSA. \n \nB.

Since the metastatic non-small cell carcinoma in specimen A is morphologically similar to the high grade prostatic adenocarcinoma in specimen B, metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma is favored. Although the metastatic tumor shows no obvious histological evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation, the focal staining of the tumor cells for Synaptophysin suggests focal neuroendocrine differentiation on immunohistochemistry. \n\nImmunohistochemically, usual adenocarcinoma of the prostate is known to demonstrate scattered neuroendocrine cells in 10% to 100% of cases, in part depending on the number of slides studied and the number of antibodies used and the clinical significance of this finding remains uncertain at present. Prostatic adenocarcinomas with scattered foci of neuroendocrine immunohistochemical expression are designated as Prostatic adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation. Some studies also suggest that the amount of neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate adenocarcinoma increases with disease progression and in response to androgen deprivation therapy.\n\n\n\n"
