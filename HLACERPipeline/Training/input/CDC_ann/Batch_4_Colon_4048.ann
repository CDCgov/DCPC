A stitch marks \"proximal.\" The specimen is received with a marked amount of attached adipose tissue, predominantly consistent with omentum. There is a 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.0 cm exophytic mass measuring 4.5 cm from the proximal margin, 71.5 cm from the distal margin, and 4.0 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The overlying serosa is puckered; this area is inked blue. Sectioning reveals gross involvement of the bowel wall. There is no gross evidence into overlying adipose tissue or through the serosa. There are multiple additional polypoid lesions measuring 0.5 cm to 1.7 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm. The stalks measure 0.2-2.5 cm. No involvement of the bowel wall is identified with these additional polypoid lesions. The polypoid lesions measure 2.8 cm from the distal margin, 50.5 cm from the mass, and 59.0 cm from the proximal margin. The polypoid lesions are 9.5 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The remaining mucosa is pink-tan and glistening, with no additional masses or lesions identified. The bowel wall averages 0.1 cm and is thickened up to 1.0 cm at the distal aspects. There are multiple diverticula, up to 2.0 cm associated with the thickened bowel wall. There is a 4.0 cm possible abscess cavity associated with the diverticula. No definitive perforation is appreciated. The thickened wall coincides with a high density of polypoid lesions (approximately 5 polypoid lesions in 8 cm). The serosa is intact, smooth and pink-tan. No defects or exudate are identified. No tattoo ink is identified in the mucosa or serosa. Multiple candidate lymph nodes are identified.

No lymphovascular invasion identified.   Tumor is 4.5 cm in greatest dimension.   Multiple additional tubular and tubulovillous adenomas, negative for high-grade     dysplasia and malignancy.   Surgical margins of resection are negative.   Multiple diverticula with chronic diverticulitis, peridiverticular scarring and     inflammation with abscess formation and acute serositis.   Twenty-two regional lymph nodes negative for tumor.   (See 17-51-2906).
