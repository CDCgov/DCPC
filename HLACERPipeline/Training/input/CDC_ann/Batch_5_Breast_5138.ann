There are two portions of tissue in the container each measuring about 2 to 2.5 cm in maximum dimension. They consist of adipose tissue partially surrounding a turquoise tinted nodule. nE\\Both portions of tissue are divided. One is submitted in blocks A1 and A2 and the other in A3 through A5. nE\nE\\Part B is labelled sentinel node #2 hot blue. The container holds a 0.7 cm turquoise tinted nodule surrounded with adipose tissue producing a maximum dimension of just over 2 cm. nE\\This portion of tissue is divided and the whole thing is submitted as block B. nE\nE\\Part C is labelled sentinel lymph node #2 hot and blue. The container holds a portion of adipose tissue surrounding a turquoise tinted nodule, the whole thing having a maximum dimension of 1.5 cm.  nE\\The specimen is divided and the whole thing submitted as block C.nE\nE\\Part D is labelled sentinel LN#4. The container holds a 0.5 cm nodule surrounded with a small amount of adipose tissue. This is divided and submitted as block D. nE\nE\\Sentinel node protocol with pancytokeratin is requested on all four nodes. nE\nE\\Part E is labelled right breast ? short superior, long lateral and double deep. This is a simple mastectomy in the form of an ellipse of skin with a medial to lateral dimension of 23 cm and a vertical dimension of 9 cm attached to a 3.5 cm depth of adipose tissue. There is a nipple slightly towards the medial end surrounded by blue dye staining. nE\nE\\This specimen is received on the day of surgery. The external aspect is coated in India ink and the specimen is then exposed to Bouin's fixative and divided so as to ensure fixation. nE\nE\\The cut surface of this specimen shows extensive ill-defined fibrous thickening running along the entire length. At the inferior lateral edge there is an ill-defined area of increased density and nodularity appreciated better on palpation than on visualization. A discrete well-defined mass lesion is not appreciated in this specimen. nE\nE\\Sections through the coarse indurated area along the lateral and central inferior end are submitted in blocks E1 through E16. The inked margin in these sections is the inferior margin. nE\nE\\Multiple sections through the ill-defined fibrous thickening in the lateral portion of this specimen are in blocks E17 through E32. These cassettes do not include any resection margins.nE\nE\\Sections through fibrous tissue in the central portion of the specimen are in E33 through E43.  Areas of calcification are noted on cutting these sections. There are no resection margins in these blocks. nE\nE\\Sections through fibrous tissue in the medial portion of the specimen are in E44 through E49. Where an inked margin appears in these sections, it is the deep or posterior margin. nE\nE\\Sections through the deep or posterior margin in the central and lateral portions of the specimen are submitted in blocks E50 through E53. nE\nE\\The nipple is in E54 and E55. A random section through the ellipse of skin in the lateral portion of the specimen is in E56.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nA Sentinel lymph node #1 hot bluenE\\B Sentinel lymph node #3 hot bluenE\\C Sentinel lymph node #2 hot bluenE\\D Sentinel lymph node #4 hot bluenE\\E Right breast mastectomy ? short superior, long lateral and double deep.\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\nSENTINEL LYMPH NODES 1 THROUGH 4 OF RIGHT AXILLA (PARTS A THROUGH D)nE\\- NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY.nE\nE\\RIGHT BREAST, SIMPLE MASTECTOMY (PART E)nE\\- HIGH GRADE IN SITU DUCTULAR CARCINOMA WITHnE\\  COMEDONECROSIS.nE\\- FIBROCYSTIC CHANGE.nE\\- FIBROADENOMA AND FIBROADENOMATOID CHANGE.\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nA Biopsy: NonE\\Time in Fixative/Formalin: 11:30nE\\Ischemic Time: NAnE\\Total Fixation Time:>72 hrsnE\\Clinical History: nE\nE\\B Biopsy: NonE\\Time in Fixative/Formalin: 11:32nE\\Total Fixation Time:>72 hrsnE\nE\\C Biopsy: NonE\\Time in Fixative/Formalin: 11:37nE\\Total Fixation Time:>72 hrsnE\nE\\D Biopsy: NonE\\Time in Fixative/Formalin: 11:38nE\\Total Fixation Time:>72 hrsnE\nE\\E Biopsy: NonE\\Time in Fixative/Formalin: 12:10nE\\Ischemic Time:40 mins.nE\\Total Fixation Time:>72 hrsnE\\Clinical History:\n\n\nPath report.microscopic observation\n\nThe specimens labelled sentinel node #1 through #4 (parts A through D) yield a total of four lymph nodes. nE\nE\\All four are examined using multiple levels stained with HTE and an immunohistochemical stain for pancytokeratin. nE\nE\\All four lymph nodes are negative for metastatic tumour. There is no micrometastatic disease and there are no isolated tumour cells.nE\nE\\The right mastectomy specimen (part E) showed a coarse indurated area in the lateral and central inferior portion.nE\nE\\This coarse indurated area shows extensive involvement with in situ ductular carcinoma.nE\nE\\The in situ carcinoma is of high nuclear grade. There is a spectrum of architectural patterns including solid, cribriform, intracystic as well as extensive comedonecrosis. Coarse calcifications are present within the areas of comedonecrosis. nE\nE\\Many of the slides are evaluated using the P63 immunohistochemical stain and all of the foci of in situ ductular carcinoma are surrounded by a P63 positive myoepithelial cell layer.nE\nE\\This specimen does not show evidence of invasive or microinvasive carcinoma.nE\nE\\The in situ carcinoma is clear of all margins. The closest margin is in the lateral inferior region which clears the in situ carcinoma by 3 mm (0.3 cm).nE\nE\\Sections through the right mastectomy specimen away from the coarse indurated area in the lateral and central inferior portion show an impressive spectrum of fibrocystic changes with stromal sclerosis, pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia, ductal ectasia, columnar cell change, apocrine metaplasia and intraductal hyperplasia of the usual type. In the central portion there is a small radial scar and at least one sclerotic fibroadenoma with areas shows fibroadenomatoid change. nE\nE\\In the lateral and central portion there are also several isolated foci of high grade ductal carcinoma in situ. These show solid and comedo architectural patterns although there is a focus in the central portion exhibiting an intracystic pattern. Additionally there are several foci of intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ involving sclerotic fibroadenomata. nE\nE\\All of these foci of in situ carcinoma are clear of the margins with some of the margins including skeletal muscle. These portions of the specimen do not show evidence of invasive carcinoma.nE\nE\\The medial portion of this specimen is completely devoid of in situ carcinoma of any grade and show only the fibrocystic changes described above.nE\nE\\The maximum dimension of the insitu carcinoma is at least one half of the length of the specimen, at least 12 cm.nE\nE\\Prominent calcifications are present throughout benign ductal and lobular structures throughout this specimen.nE\nE\\Sections through the nipple fail to show any evidence of pagetoid ascension of tumour cells. Dermal lymphatic permeation or cutaneous involvement is not identified.\n\n\n"
