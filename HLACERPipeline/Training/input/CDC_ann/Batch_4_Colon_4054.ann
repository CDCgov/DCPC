The specimen is received in formalin identified by the requisition and container as \", right colon.\"  Part of bowel received: Terminal ileum, cecum, and colon. The appendix is absent. Specimen length: 36.5 cm. Tumor location: Cecum. Gross appearance of tumor: Tan-pink and red-brown fungating tumor mass filling the entire cecal cavity with focal tan-gold and amber roughening at borders. Tumor dimensions: 8 x 6.5 x 5.2 cm. Circumferential growth: 100%. Gross depth of invasion: Extends into but does not grossly appear to penetrate the  muscle wall. Luminal obstruction: 100%. Bowel circumference at tumor site: 9 cm. Gross distance of tumor from margins:  Proximal=15.5 cm.  Distal=19 cm.  Nearest radial resection margin=3.5 cm.  Nearest serosal surface=0.3 cm. Other remarkable features: Situated 2 cm distal to the primary tumor is a red-gold polypoid mass, 1.2 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm. Tissue submitted for special investigations: None. Block summary: 1A -- proximal resection margin. 1B -- distal resection margin. 1C -- nearest radial resection margin. 1D-1G -- tumor with nearest serosal surface represented in 1D. 1H -- separate adenomatous polyp. 1I -- representative sections from previously biopsied polyp sites. 1J-1N -- 12 candidate lymph nodes. Detached within the container is a portion of pink-gold omentum, 26.5 x 12 x 1.2 cm. Sectioned surfaces display lobular pink-gold fatty tissue joined by strands of pink- gray and red-brown fibrous membrane and vascular structures. Distinct nodularity is not grossly identified. Representative sections are submitted as cassettes 1O and 1P. 2. The specimen is received in formalin identified by the requisition and container as \", new distal margin.\" A segment of tan-gray colon, 4.5 cm in length and up to 1.5 cm in diameter is focally roughened and discolored red-brown over the serosal surface with up to 1.8 cm of attached mesoappendiceal fat. The cut surfaces display tan-pink mucosal folds along with a focus of depression up to 1 cm in diameter grossly consistent with a previous polypectomy site. The previous polypectomy site is trisected and totally submitted as cassette 2A and the resection margins are submitted in cassettes 2B-C respectively. (csb) 3. The specimen is received in formalin identified by the requisition and container as \", gallbladder and contents.\"  Previously opened: No. Measurements: 6.2 x 3.5 x 2.8 cm. External surface: Gray-green with focal red-brown roughening. Wall thickness: 0.3 cm. Mucosa: Dark green coursely granular and glistening.
