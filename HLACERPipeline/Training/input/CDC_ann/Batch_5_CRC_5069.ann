If microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is\n   identified in this case, a referral to Cancer Genetics is recommended.\n   There are exceptions to the above interpretation. These results should\n   not be considered in isolation, and clinical correlation with genetic\n   counseling is recommended to assess the need for germline testing.\nPlease see attached addendum. /db\n\n\nPath report.gross description\n\nThe specimen is received in a container with 10% formalin, labeled with the\npatient's name and 'right colon and terminal ileum'.\nRESECTION SPECIMEN: Hemicolectomy\nTotal length of specimen: 35.0 cm\nCircumference proximal margin: 4.0 cm received stapled\nCircumference distal margin: 5.3 cm received stapled\nPericolic soft tissue: 4.8 cm in depth\nTerminal ileum: length 9.0 cm\n        circumference 4.0 cm\nAppendix: no appendix is grossly observed        \nTUMOUR:\nNumber of tumours: 1\nPrimary Tumour site: Ascending colon (cecum is thoroughly examined and no lesion is\ngrossly identified\nSize: 3.0 x 3.5 x 1.1 cm (length x width x thickness)\n90 % of circumference involved\nMinimal luminal diameter 0.2 cm\nConfiguration: Ulcerated with rolled edges\nDescriptive Characteristics: Firm\nSerosa overlying tumour: The serosa overlying the tumor is inked blue, and shows\nareas of puckering\nSerosal perforation: The tumor extends up to the serosal margin but perforation\ncannot be grossly identified.\nDistance from margins:\n            proximal 17.5 cm,\n            distal 14.5 cm\n            radial/circumferential 1.2 cm\n\nExtension into pericolic tissue: The tumor grossly extends into the pericolic\ntissue. \nMacroscopic tumour perforation: No\n\nLesions in non-tumoural mucosa: The colon is thoroughly examined and no additional\nlesions are identified.
