The specimen is received fresh labeled \", right lower lobe wedge.\" It consists of a triangular shaped fragment of lung parenchyma with lines of staples along 2 aspects. The overall dimensions are 3.5 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm. An area of tan pleural discoloration is present, which measures up to 5 mm. This area abuts the line of resection. Incising this area demonstrates a tan ill-defined slightly firm area measuring 5 mm as identified on cross sections. This area is completely submitted for frozen section examination. The remainder of the specimen is placed in formalin for fixation prior to further sampling and evaluation. Post fixation, the staple line is removed and the adjacent margin is inked blue. Further sectioning and palpating the specimen reveals 1 additional firm white-tan nodular area measuring 0.3 cm in greatest dimension, which is located 0.4 cm from the closest portion of the stapled margin. This nodule is located at a pleural surface. No additional nodules are grossly identified. The remaining tissue is entirely submitted for permanent sections as follows: 1A, the entire small nodule; 1B-1D, all remaining tissue. (GSH/AAC/cc6) 2. Specimen #2 if received fresh labeled \", right middle lobe wedge.\" It consists of a fragment of lung parenchyma, which measures 7.3 x 4.1 x 1.6 cm. The pleural surface is retracted with underlying nodularity. This area measures approximately 15 mm. There is a small area of pleural defect over the nodular area. Sections demonstrate a nodular cavitary lesion, which measures 17 x 21 mm. Grossly it appears to be located approximately 15 mm from the staple line of resection. A representative frozen section is taken, perpendicularly oriented, with the tissue adjacent to the staple line marked with blue ink. Post fixation, the remaining staple line is removed and the adjacent margin is inked blue. Further sectioning the remaining tissue reveals no additional lesions. Additional sections of the mass are submitted for permanent sections in cassettes 2A-2C, with each section including overlying pleural surfaces and with 2A-2B also including the closest remaining areas of the margin inked blue. (GSH/AAC/cc6) 3. Container 3 is labeled as \"Wall, Maurice Allyn, deeper margin right middle lobe. Received in formalin is a 26 g, 14.0 x 2.2 x 2.0 cm wedge shaped portion of lung with 2 long staple lines present along opposite edges of the specimen. The pleural surfaces are smooth and red-tan with no suspicious areas. Both staple lines are removed and 1 displays areas of adjacent hemorrhagic discoloration, consistent with a recent resection site. Tissue adjacent to the apparent recent resection site is inked orange and the tissue adjacent to the opposite staple line/apparent margin is inked blue. Serially sectioning the specimen reveals red-tan spongy parenchyma throughout with no discrete lesions. Representative full-thickness cross sections are submitted in cassettes 3A-3C.

Deeper margins right middle lobe\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - Tumor in specimens numbers 1 and 2 are morphologically identical. A moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma is present which is subjected to immunohistochemical stains on block 2B. Tumor cells are strongly positive for cytokeratin 7 and largely negative for cytokeratin 20 with a few isolated, strongly positive cells, albeit rare. Approximately 5 to 10% of the tumor shows moderate to focally strong nuclear positivity for CDX2, a marker of gastrointestinal cancers. Lung cancer marker, TTF-1, is negative as well as lung cancer marker, Napsin A. Napsin A strongly marks normal alveolar lining cells. Tumor is negative for squamous cell marker, p63, and shows no positivity for prostate specific antigen or prostate specific acid phosphatase. Elastic stains performed on both specimens 1 and 2 show invasion of and involvement of visceral pleural tissues. Areas of lymphatic invasion are identified. This patient's history of esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemo and radiation therapy in 2015 is noted as well as the patient's history of prior prostate carcinoma. Morphologically, this adenocarcinoma could be consistent with either upper gastrointestinal tract primary or primary lung adenocarcinoma. The immunoperoxidase panel is most consistent with a metastasis of upper gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma (cytokeratin positive, focal CD20 positivity, and focal CDX2 positivity, with negative markers for primary lung adenocarcinoma). There is no evidence of marking consistent with a metastatic prostate carcinoma. Therefore, these special studies provide evidence which would favor that these pulmonary nodules are a metastasis of this patient's previous esophageal primary cancer rather than primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Immunoperoxidase control slides stain appropriately. Previous biopsy, 17-21-7937, performed on pulmonary nodule is noted.\n\n\n"
