Received fresh labeled \", wedge right lower lobe lung,\" is a 26 gm tan- pink wedge biopsy of lung measuring 9.5 x 3.2 x 2.0 cm. The pleural surface demonstrates puckering with a firm mass present underneath which measures approximately 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. The pleural surface is inked black. The staple line is removed and the parenchymal surface is marked with silver nitrate. The specimen is sectioned and reveals a pulmonary mass which extends to approximately 0.5 cm from the parenchymal margin that was marked with silver nitrate. A representative section is submitted for frozen diagnosis. 1FSA, 1/1. Postfixation, the specimen is further sectioned revealing the previously described mass to measure 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.3 cm. No additional masses are identified. Representative sections are submitted for permanent sections as follows: 1A-1B, mass including the closest remaining areas of the margin, 1C-1D, mass including the greatest areas of pleural surface puckering. (AAC/ls12) 2. Received fresh labeled \", right lower lobe lung,\" is a completion lobectomy weighing 194 g and measuring 15.0 x 10.0 x 7.0 cm. Instructions are present indicating freeze bronchial margin. Numerous staple lines are present. The staple line from the bronchus is removed and the next portion is shaved and submitted for frozen diagnosis 2FSA, 1/1. Postfixation, a stapled parenchymal margin is present adjacent to the hilum, displaying no corresponding suspicious tissue. The pleural surfaces are smooth, red-tan and glistening with no suspicious areas. Located 3.5 cm from the hilum is a staple line with adjacent hemorrhagic discoloration, consistent with a resection site, measuring 11.0 cm in length. Sectioning the adjacent tissue reveals no suspicious areas. The stapled resection line measures 5.5 cm from the stapled parenchymal margin. Further sectioning the remaining lung tissue reveals red-tan spongy parenchyma throughout with no discrete lesions. Within the hilum are multiple possible lymph nodes each displaying anthracotic pigmentation, ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted for permanent sections as follows: 2A, hilar vascular margins, each shaved off and entirely submitted and a section of the bronchus adjacent to the previously frozen bronchial margin, 2B-2C, hemorrhagic tissue adjacent to the stapled apparent resection site, 2D, the portion of the stapled parenchymal margin closest to the resection site, 2E-2F, 2 possible lymph nodes per cassette, each bisected and inked for differentiation, 2G, 4 possible lymph nodes, each submitted intact. (AAC/ls12) 3. Container 3 is labeled as \", level 7 nodes.\" Received in formalin are 7 fragments of lymphoid appearing tissue displaying anthracotic pigmentation and minimal surface fatty tissue. The pieces range from 0.4 to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension and are each entirely submitted as follows: 3A-3B, 1 possible lymph node, serially sectioned, 3C-3D, 1 possible lymph node, serially sectioned, 3E, 1 possible lymph node, trisected, 3F, 2 possible lymph nodes with 1 inked blue and bisected and the second trisected and submitted without ink, 3G, 2 possible lymph nodes with 1 inked blue and bisected and the second submitted intact without ink. (AAC/ls12) 4. Container 4 is labeled as \", level 8 nodes.\" Received in formalin is a single possible lymph node displaying anthracotic pigmentation. The specimen measures 1.0 cm in greatest dimension, is bisected and is entirely submitted in cassette 4A. (ls12) 5. Container 4 is labeled as \", level 10 nodes.\" Received in formalin, and obtained through filtration are multiple friable fragments of lymphoid appearing tissue displaying anthracotic pigmentation. The specimen measures a single possible lymph node displaying anthracotic pigmentation. The specimen measures 2.0 x 1.2 x 0.2 cm in aggregate and is entirely submitted in cassette 5A. (AAC/ls12) 6. Container 6 is labeled as \", level 4 high.\" Received in formalin, are 3 fragments of lymphoid appearing tissue displaying anthracotic pigmentation, ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 cm in greatest dimension. The 3 fragments of lymphoid appearing tissue are each entirely submitted as follows: 6A, 1 piece, bisected, 6B, the remaining 2 pieces, each intact. (AAC/ls12) 7. Container 7 is labeled as \", level 4 low.\" Received in formalin, is a single fragment of lymphoid appearing tissue displaying anthracotic pigmentation, and minimal surface fatty tissue. The piece measures 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, is bisected and is entirely submitted in cassette 7A. (AAC/ls12) 8. Container 8 is labeled as \", level 12 nodes.\" Received in formalin, are multiple friable fragments of lymphoid appearing tissue displaying anthracotic pigmentation, measuring 1.5 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm in aggregate. Multiple staples are present. After removing the staples, the remaining tissue is entirely submitted in cassette 8A. (JSP/AAC/ls12)\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\n1.
