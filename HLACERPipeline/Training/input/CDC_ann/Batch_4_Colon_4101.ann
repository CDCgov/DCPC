The specimen includes 4 cm of terminal ileum and 9.5 cm of colon. An appendix is not present. The serosa is red- pink and smooth. There is a moderate amount of attached yellow fat. Opening reveals a slightly depressed and slightly exophytic mass at the periphery of the cecum and involving the ileocecal valve and ascending colon. The mass is 3.5 x 2.0 cm. Approximately of the mass has raised, rolled borders and a central depression while the other half of the mass has a pink bosselated exophytic appearance. The mass is 4 cm from the proximal margin, 5 cm from the distal margin and 8.6 cm from the mesenteric margin. The fat and soft tissue below the mass are inked blue. Sectioning through the mass reveals a firm white cut surface with a depth of 1.0 cm. The mass grossly focally involves the colonic wall and may invade through it. The remaining colonic mucosa is pink with prominent folds. There is a single pink sessile polyp present which is 0.2 x 0.2 cm. The polyp is 0.6 cm from the mass. The underlying fat is examined for lymph nodes. Summary of sections: 1A, representative en face proximal and distal margins, 2/1; 1B, en face mesenteric margin, 1/1; 1C, mass to include the ileocecal valve, 1/1; 1D-F, representative sections of the mass, 1/1 each; 1G, entire polyp, 1/1; 1H, multiple intact lymph nodes, M/1; 1I, 2 bisected lymph nodes, 1 of the lymph nodes is inked blue, 4/1; 1J, multiple intact lymph nodes, M/1; 1K, 1 bisected lymph node, 2/1; 1L, 1 serially sectioned lymph node, 4/1.

COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing. ## End of auxiliary report ## Molecular Diagnostic Rpt: BRAF Mutation Analysis/Reviewer: SEE COMMENT BRAF Mutation Analysis/BRAF Mutation: NOT DETECTED BRAF Mutation Analysis/BRAF Mutation Interpretation: This specimen showed no evidence of a mutation in the <i>BRAF</i> gene.

This result is consistent with a competent mismatch repair function. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS).<BR/><BR/>Microsatellite Instability Analysis has multifaceted clinical utility: as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response; as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for colorectal carcinoma; and as a genetic risk biomarker for the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as Lynch Syndrome.<BR/><BR/>As an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy biomarker, recent literature (Le, et al., <i>N Engl J Med</i> 372:2509-2520; Topolian, et al., <i>Nature Reviews Cancer</i> 16:275-287) indicates that, in general, patients that are Microsatellite Stable (MSS) have a poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.<BR/><BR/>MSS tumors have poorer prognosis than MSI-H tumors, and better response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. <BR/><BR/>As a genetic risk biomarker, the result of MSS is inconsistent with Lynch syndrome. However, if the clinical suspicion remains high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result, consideration should be given to a genetic consult to direct additional testing. <BR/><BR/>Interpretation of this result of MSS in the context of other clinical and laboratory findings is strongly recommended.

The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist and representative areas of tumor and normal tissue selected. These areas were microdissected from the surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA extracted using standard methods (QIAGEN QIASymphony). The tumor and normal DNA were separately PCR amplified for five microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27; Promega Corp.), and size fractionated via capillary electrophoresis (Life Technologies 3500xl). The tumor and normal profiles were compared to determine the presence of altered microsatellite profiles. The analytic sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10-20% and is dependent on the size and clonality of any instability. The presence of instability in less than 10-20% of the DNA examined will not be detected. This assay uses reagents that may be marked as Research Use Only or Analyte Specific Reagent.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: exons 2, 3 and 4 consisting of codons 10-35, 55-76, 109-131 and 138-150 (specifically including codons G12, G13, Q61, K117, A146). <BR/><BR/>Colombino, , et al. <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i> 30.20 (2012): 2522-2529. 2.
