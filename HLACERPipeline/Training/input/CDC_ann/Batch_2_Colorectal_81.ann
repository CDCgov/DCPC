Perry Chan, Ph.D., MBA DABMG, DABCC, DLMcm, M(ASCP)cm, MB(ASCP)cm Methodology: Genomic DNA was isolated from the provided tumor specimen. Exons 2, 3 and 4 of the NRAS gene were subjected to SNaPshot multiplex PCR and primer extension for mutation detection. This assay is able to detect 5% mutation in a background of wild-type DNA. Intended Use: The detection of a NRAS mutation aids in identification of patients with worse prognosis and who may not respond to certain cancer therapies. References: 1.

The serosa is tan-pink, smooth and displays mesentery running the entire length of the specimen and measures up to 7.7 cm in thickness. The specimen is opened to reveal a tan-pink mucosa with a 5.7 x 2.4 x 2.2 cm Meckel's diverticulum and a3.5 cm well healed anastomotic scar. These are 2.1 cm and 15.1 cm respectively from the proximal margin. Within the central portion of the colon segment is a 7.2 x 5.0 x 1.2 cm circumferential, ulcerated lesion with raised borders. The lesion is 6.4 cm from the distal margin and widely free of the proximal margin. Sectioning through the lesion reveals invasion through the muscularis and into the adjacent mesentery. The lesion possibly involves the serosa and is 4.6 cm from the mesenteric margin. Sectioning through the mesentery reveals 24 possible lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 up to 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm. Section code: A1-proximal margin, A2-distal margin, A3-mesenteric margin A4- serosa closest to lesion, A5-represents section of Meckel's diverticulum, A6-representative sections immediately proximal and immediately distal to anastomotic scar, A7-representative section of lesion and adjacent normal mucosa, A8-additional section of lesion with inked serosa, A9- 6 possible lymph nodes, A10- 6 possible lymph nodes, A11- 6 possible lymph nodes, A12- 6 possible lymph nodes.\n\n\nPayment procedure\n\nCPT                            .88309 88329 88342 88341 88341 88341 88341 88341 88341 88341 88381 81479 81311\n\n\n"
