There is a suture marking the axillary contents. Laterally there is a 10.5 x 3.0 x 1.0 cm portion of axillary tail. Anteriorly, there is a 17.0 x 11.0 cm tan mottled skin ellipse. The everted pink nipple areolar complex which is 1.2 x 1.0 cm. There are 2 scars, the 1st scar is located lateral and is 1.5 cm in length. The 2nd scar is located superior and is 1.5 cm in length. There is a flat gray irregular lesion on the lateral skin which is 1.0 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior-blue, posterior-black. The specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral. Sectioning reveals a pearly circumscribed hard pink-white tumor. This tumor has central hemorrhage and scarring. It is in the center of the specimen at the junction of the upper outer and upper inner quadrants. The tumor is 6.0 x 4.0 x 2.2 cm. It is 1.5 cm from the inked deep margin, 1.0 cm from the overlying skin surface and 2.0 cm from the nearest inked anterior margin. The remaining breast is composed of yellow glistening fat. Sectioning laterally reveals several tan-pink lymph nodes. Summary of sections: 1A, anterior nipple, 4/1; 1B, representative sections of each of the skin scars and a section through the papule, 3/1; 1C, skin closest to the tumor, 1/1 (includes underlying tumor); 1D-H, sections of the tumor submitted from lateral to medial (D and E are adjacent sections of the tumor), 1/1 each; 1I, uninvolved parenchyma from the lower outer quadrant, 2/1; 1J, uninvolved parenchyma from the lower inner quadrant, 2/1; 1K, 1 bisected lymph node, 2/1; 1L, multiple intact lymph nodes, M/1; 1M, 1 bisected lymph node, 2/1; 1N, 1 possible bisected lymph node, 2/1.
