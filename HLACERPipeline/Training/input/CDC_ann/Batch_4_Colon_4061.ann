The specimen is labeled \"right colon\" on both the requisition and the container. Received in formalin is a previously opened 20 cm segment of colon, contiguous with a 4.2 cm segment of terminal ileum. There is up to 8 cm of attached fatty tissue noted over the serosa. Appendix is not present. The specimen displays no gross evidence of perforation. The mucosa is tan and velvety and displays a lobular tan-pink polypoid structure, 4.0 x 3.9 x up to 0.9 cm, 9.5 cm from the distal margin. The lesion does not grossly involve the serosa. The lesion is grossly 70cm from the mesenteric margin. The lesion grossly appears to involve the mucosa an submucosa with no identifiable extension into the muscularis propria. The remaining mucosa is tan and velvety and arranged in transverse folds. Additional mucosal masses are not grossly identified. There are occasional possible diverticula. The ileocecal valve is grossly unremarkable. The small bowel mucosa is tan and velvety and is arranged in transverse folds. Lesions are not grossly evident. Section summary:   1A, proximal margin   1B, distal margin   1C, mesenteric cut surface   1D-J, lesion, totally submitted   1K, possible diverticula   1L, ileocecal valve After review of the initial sections, the fatty tissue examined, revealing 15 candidate lymph nodes, up to 1.6 cm in maximum dimension. Each is totally submitted. Section summary:   1M-N, 4 bisected candidate lymph nodes, 2 per cassette;   1O-P, 11 candidate lymph nodes, each submitted whole;   1Q-U, additional representative fatty tissue.

These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing.
