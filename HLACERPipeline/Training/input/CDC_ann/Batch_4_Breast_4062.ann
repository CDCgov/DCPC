Entirely submitted in 2 cassettes, 5/1A and 1B. Also received in the specimen container is an aggregate of pale white-yellow fibrofatty soft tissue measuring 1.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. The remainder of the specimen is filtered and entirely submitted in cassette 1C, M/1C.\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - 2cm mass 12:00 location\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\nBreast, right 12-o'clock, core biopsy:   Infiltrating mammary carcinoma, no special type (ductal), high combined histologic     grade.   Tumor involves the majority of submitted cores and is at least 14 mm in greatest     dimension.   No lymphovascular invasion identified.   See comment.\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nHormone Receptor report: Neoplastic cells are POSITIVE for nuclear estrogen receptor. Neoplastic cells are POSITIVE for nuclear progesterone receptor. Neoplastic cells show NO IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE (Score 1+) of HER-2 overexpression, HER-2 status will be confirmed by FISH. ## End of auxiliary report ## Fish Report: FISH - NEGATIVE for HER2 oncogene amplification by FISH analysis  NEGATIVE for chromosome 17 polysomy by FISH analysis       ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.microscopic examination\n\nMicroscopic examination performed.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nRight breast biopsy\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - Hormone receptor and HER2 studies will be performed and reported as an addendum. FISH Comments - The HER2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) did not reveal amplification of the HER2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 1.06 and a Her2 copy number of 2.28, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. There was no evidence of polysomy/polyploidy or genetic heterogeneity. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
