The presence\nof specific mutations in exons 18, 19, 20 or 21 of the EGFR gene have been\nassociated with a favourable response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.\nConversely, several mutations have been associated with resistance to TKI therapy.\nThese molecular test results should be correlated with other findings.\nSUMMARY AND TECHNICAL DETAILS\nAssay: DNA was extracted from foramlin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour tissue and\nscreened for 29 different EGFR gene mutations using a real-time PCR assay (EntroGen\nEGFR mutation Analysis kit). [3].\nEGFR Mutation Panel:\nExon 18: G719S (c.2155G>A, G719C (c.2155G>T), G719A (c.2156G>C)\nExon 19: 19 different deletions and complex mutations (all in-frame)\nExon 20: S768I (c.2303G>T), T790M (c.2369C>T).A767_V769dup (c.2299_2307dup),\np.His773dup (c.2317_2319dup), p.Asp770_Asn771insGly (c.2310_2311insGGT)\nExon 21: L858R (c.2573T>G, L861Q (c.2582T>A)\nReference sequence: NM_005228.3\nLimitations: This test is limited to the 29 EGFR mutations listed above, and will\nnot detect other EGFR mutations. This assay cannot detect mutations occurring at\nfrequencies less than the demonstrated limited of detection (LOD), which is\nestimated to be less than 5%.\nThe assay detects 19 different deletions and complex mutations of exon 19, but does\nnot distinguish between them. The assay detects 3 different missense mutations\ninvolving codon 719 (G719S, G719C, G719A), but does not distinguish between them.\nThe assay detects the c.2317_2319dup and c.2310_2311insGGT mutations of exon 20, but\ndoes not distinguish between them.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Nat Rev Cancer 2007; 7:169-181 (PMID 17318210), [2] Oncogene 2009; 28:S24-S31\n(PMID 19680293), [3] Oncol Rep 2013; 30: 1045-152 (PMID 23817662)\nBrenda Murphy, PhD, FCCMG (Molecular)  Number: 16: MO1960\nHOSPITAL Regional Laboratory Medicine Program\nRegional Genetics Services of South Central Ontario\nDepartment of Laboratory Medicine\nMcMaster University Medical Center Site\n1200 Main St., West - Room 3N20\nHOSPITAL, ON L8S 4J9\n-----------------------------------------\nLUNG CORE BIOPSY, LEFT UPPER LOBE:\n   -  EGFR MUTATION POSITIVE, ALK RE-ARRANGEMENT NEGATIVE\nTest performed on Spec #: S16-9365\n             Block A1\nAdequacy of Sample for Testing: Adequate\nEstimated % Tumor Cellularity: 15\nRefer to Molecular Oncology Report: 16: MO1960\nEGFR Mutational Analysis: Mutation(s) identified\n   Exon 21 Leu858Arg\nEGFR Exons Assessed: 18  19 20 21\nEGFR Mutational Analysis Testing Method(s):\nReal-time PCR\n   EntroGen EGFR Mutation Analysis Kit Exons 18-21\nALK Rearrangement: No rearrangement detected\nALK Rearrangement Testing Method(s):\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC)\nIHC Method: 5A4 antibody using Leica Bond Refine detection system\n\nDr. J.
