The specimen is labeled with the patient's name and as \"small bowel\"\n\nRESECTION SPECIMEN: A segment of bowel received stapled at both ends, oriented with a short suture designated as the distal margin and a long suture designated as margin lateral.\n\nFIXATION: 10% buffered formalin\n\nDIMENSIONS:\nLength of bowel: 29.5 cm\nCircumference of bowel: From 3.0 cm to 4.8 cm\nMesentery: 11.0 x 1.0 x 3.0 cm\nAdditional structures: Nil\n\nSEROSA: There are multiple adhesions between the short loops of the bowel specimen.
