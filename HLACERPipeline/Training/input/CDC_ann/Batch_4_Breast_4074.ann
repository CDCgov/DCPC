Received in fixative labeled \"\" and \"right breast, stitch marks 12- o'clock\" is a 351 g mastectomy (18.5 x 15.0 x 4.0 cm) with an attached tan ellipse of skin (13.6 x 3.5 cm), containing a 2.5 cm areola and a 1.0 cm everted nipple. No discrete lesions or other gross abnormalities are identified on the skin surface. The superior superficial margin is marked with blue ink, the inferior superficial margin is marked with red ink, and the deep margin is marked with black ink. Serially sectioning the breast reveals a poorly circumscribed area of gray-white fibrous tissue (4.0 x 2.5 cm) within the center of breast. There is a silver metallic marker lodged in the center of the fibroglandular tissue. No definite lesions are identified in this area. The remainder of the cut surface is composed of yellow lobulated adipose tissue with approximately 5-10% associated gray-white fibroglandular tissue. There are 4 possible lymph nodes (0.5 to 2.2 cm in maximum dimension) identified within the lateral breast. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A central section of nipple, 1/1; 1B-1C tissue containing the clip, 1/1 each; 1D-1F additional sections of the surrounding fibroglandular tissue, 1/1 each; 1G deep margin closest to the clip, 1/1; 1H inferior superficial margin closest to the clip, 1/1; 1I superior superficial margin closest to the clip, 1/1; 1J 1 lymph node, 4/1; 1K 1 lymph node, 3/1; 1L 2 color coded and bisected lymph nodes, 4/1; 1M upper outer quadrant, 1/1; 1N lower outer quadrant, 1/1; 1O lower inner quadrant, 1/1; 1P upper inner quadrant, 1/1. Additional sections of fibroglandular tissue: 1Q-1R adjacent sections, 1/1 each, 1S-1T, adjacent sections, 1/1 each, 1U, 2/1. 2. Received in fixative labeled \"\" and \"left breast with axillary contents, stitch at 12-o'clock\" is a 425 g mastectomy (18.5 x 17.0 x 4.0 cm) with an attached tan ellipse of skin (16.5 x 3.8 cm), containing a 2.4 cm areola and a 0.9 cm somewhat flattened nipple. There is a small amount of attached and detached axillary tissue (6.5 x 3.5 x 2.8 cm in maximum dimension) identified in the upper outer quadrant and in the specimen container. No gross lesions are identified on the skin surface. The superior superficial margin is marked with blue ink, the inferior superficial margin is marked with red ink, and the deep margin is marked with black ink. Serially sectioning the specimen reveals a poorly circumscribed, gray-white indurated nodule (1.1 x 0.8 cm) in the lower inner portion of the breast. The nodule lies 1.0 cm from the deep margin, 2.2 cm from the inferior superficial margin, and approximately 2.5 cm medial and slightly inferior to the nipple. There is an abundance of gray-white fibroglandular tissue (6.2 x 3.0 cm) identified surrounding the nodule and extending into the central portion of the breast. A silver metallic marker is lodged within the fibrous tissue in the central portion of the breast. No definite residual tumor is identified surrounding the tumor marker. The remainder of the cut surface is composed of yellow lobulated adipose tissue with approximately 10-15% associated gray-white fibroglandular tissue. Sectioning the attached axillary tissue reveals a 0.3 x 0.3 cm lymph node within the highest axillary tissue. The remainder of the axillary contents contains 15 additional possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.4 to 1.5 cm in maximum dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 2A central section of nipple, 1/1; 2B-2C tissue containing the tumor marker, 1/1 each; 2D-2E nodule to include the deep margin, 1/1 each; 2F-2J fibroglandular tissue surrounding the nodule and tumor marker, 1/1 each; 2K superior superficial margin closest to the tumor marker, 1/1; 2L inferior superficial margin closest to the lesion, 1/1; 2M upper outer quadrant, 1/1; 2N lower outer quadrant, 1/1; 2O lower inner quadrant, 1/1; 2P upper inner quadrant, 1/1; 2Q highest axillary node, 2/1; 2R 2 color coded and bisected nodes, 4/1; 2S 2 color coded and bisected nodes, 4/1; 2T 2 color coded and bisected nodes, 4/1; 2U 2 color coded and bisected nodes, 4/1; 2V 2 color coded and bisected nodes, 4/1; 2W 2 color coded and bisected nodes, 4/1; 2X 1 trisected node, 3/1; 2Y 2 color coded and bisected nodes, 4/1.
