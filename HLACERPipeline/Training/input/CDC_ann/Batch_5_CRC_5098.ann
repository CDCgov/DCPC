SEE NOTE.\nNOTE:\nBiopsy consists of multiple fragments of villous adenoma with cribriforming glands.\nSome fragments show desmoplastic reaction in lamina propria around angulated small\nglands. This raises the possibility of invasion into stroma; however, the fragmented\nnature of biopsy and absence of muscularis mucosae and submucosa are limiting\nfactors for further assessment. (CODE 1)\n\n\nGROSS PATHOLOGY\n\nThe specimen is received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and as \"polyp 50 cm colon\". The specimen consists of multiple\nfragments of pale tan to tan-brown soft tissue ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.7 cm in\ngreatest dimension. All tissue is submitted for microscopy in cassette A1.\n                                        /WS\n\n\nADDENDUMS\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nCOLONIC POLYPECTOMY (50CM), MARCH 29, 2016; WOHS:\n   -  FAVOUR LOW-GRADE ADENOCARCINOMA ARISING IN A TUBULOVILLOUS ADENOMA\nCOMMENT:\nThis case has been reviewed by the HOSPITAL 12, Pathology \\T\\ Laboratory\nMedicine Gastrointestinal Pathology Service (Drs. R, Kirsch, A. Pollett, J. Conner\nand R. Riddell).\nThe specimen is fragmented which makes assessment of invasion difficult. In our\nopinion, there appear to be malignant glands with an infiltrative edge associated\nwith a desmoplastic stromal response, favouring an invasive adenocarcinoma. There\nare no high-risk features for lymphatic invasion (no high-grade tumour\ndifferentiation, no lymphovascular space invasion and non tumour budding). The\nsupplied keratin stain (cam5.2) highlights the infiltrative tumour nests and lack of\nbudding. The fragmentation of the specimen makes it impossible to assess the margin\nof resection and endoscopic correlation is needed to ensure that the tumour has been\ncompletely excised.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:\nIncorporated in diagnosis and comment.\nDr. X\nAccession #: SP-16-7358\nHOSPITAL 12, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine\n600 University Ave, HOSPITAL Ont.
