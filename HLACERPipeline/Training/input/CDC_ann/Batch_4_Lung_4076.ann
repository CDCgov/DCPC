A panel of immunoperoxidase stains is performed on this lung biopsy which contains a diminishing small amount of adenocarcinoma remaining in the block. Tumor cells are positive for both cytokeratin 20 and cytokeratin 7. There is some evidence of Napsin A positivity, but TTF-1 stain is negative. A small amount of tumor present in the block is negative for PAX8 but there is moderate nuclear staining for CDX2. Control slides stain appropriately. Whereas these results are not entirely conclusive, they could point to evidence that this well differentiated adenocarcinoma could be of upper gastrointestinal tract/pancreatic origin. The conclusive nature of this study is not optimal due to the diminishing amount of rare tumor material in the paraffin block. Consideration of sampling of abdominal tumor could provide insights for a more definitive classification. Further followup is suggested as clinically indicated. Dr.  has reviewed the original diagnositic slides at time of diagnosis as well as the additional immunoperoxidase stains. ## End of auxiliary report ## Molecular Diagnostic Rpt: EGFR Mutation Analysis/Reviewer: SEE COMMENT EGFR Mutation Analysis/EGFR Mutation: NOT DETECTED EGFR Mutation Analysis/EGFR Mutation Interpretation: This specimen showed no evidence of a mutation in the <i>EGFR</i> gene.

Basic lung molecular panel will be performed and subsequently reported. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed no break-apart signal patterns for ALK (2p23) in the cells analyzed. However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with other clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.   In spite of repeat hybridizations with various pretreatment and pepsin treatments times, successful hybridization was not achieved for ROS1, therefore FISH analysis was not possible. Possible causes include: insufficient sample size or DNA modification due to sample processing.    FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  ALK Breakapart (5`ALK; 3`ALK) - FDA Approved (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)   References:  J Mol Diagn. 2013 Apr 4. doi:pii: S1525-1578(13)00041-X.
