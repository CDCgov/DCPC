This assay is able to detect 5% mutation in a background of wild-type DNA. Intended Use: The detection of a BRAF V600 gene mutation aids in the specific diagnosis of certain cancers, such as hairy cell leukemia, and help to identify patients with worse prognosis and who may be responsive to certain therapies in a variety of cancers.

Received fresh for gross consult, labeled \"Myers-sigmoid colon\" is a 28 cm segment of apparent colon measuring approximately 6 cm in average circumference. The proximal aspect is patent and the distal aspect is stapled. The serosa is red-tan, smooth and glistening. The mesentery appears to run the proximal 26 cm of the specimen and measures up to approximately 9 cm. The specimen is opened along the antimesenteric aspect to reveal a firm red-tan mass measuring approximately 1.6 x 1.5 x 0.3 cm. This mass is predominantly anti-mesenteric and located 4.5 cm from the stapled distal margin. The mucosa surrounding the mass is black-gray and discolored, consistent with a previous tattoo. Grossly, the mass appears to involve the adjacent muscularis propria but does not appear to invade through it. The remainder of the mucosa appears grossly unremarkable. The attached mesenteric tissue is thoroughly sectioned and palpated to reveal 10 possible lymph nodes. The specimen will be revisited tomorrow following additional formalin fixation. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1-proximal margin, en face A2-distal margin, en face A3-A7-mass described above in its entirety A8-8 possible lymph nodes A9-2 possible lymph nodes (JDM; 7/11/2017) Following additional formalin fixation, the mesenteric tissue is reexamined to reveal 6 additional possible lymph nodes. These additional possible lymph nodes are submitted entirely in cassette A10. (JDM; 7/12/2017) B. Received in formalin, labeled \"Myers-proximal ring\" is a 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.3 cm gray-brown ragged tissue fragment consistent with colon. The specimen features multiple sutures and staples. The sutures and staples are removed and the specimen is sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes B1-B2. (JDM; 7/11/2017) C. Received in formalin, labeled \"Myers-distal ranging\" is a 2.3 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm gray-brown ragged tissue fragment consistent with colon. The specimen features multiple sutures and staples. The sutures and staples are removed, and the specimen is trisected and submitted entirely in cassettes C1-C2.

Clinical correlation is recommended. KRAS, NRAS, and possible BRAF mutational analyses are pending and will be reported in an addendum when available. BRAF mutation analysis will only be performed if both KRAS and NRAS are negative. (JK:mgr; 7/12/2017)\n\n\n"
