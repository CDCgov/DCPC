KRAS Gene Mutation Analysis INTERPRETATION:   The specimen was negative for the tested seven KRAS gene mutations. Indication for Study:   Adenocarcinoma Specimen Type:     Paraffin-Embedded Tissue-Colon Comments: The KRAS test is designed to detect seven mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene (see methodology). These seven mutations account for >97% of all reported KRAS mutations in CRC patients. Samples with results reported as \"no mutations detected\" may harbor KRAS mutations that are not detected by the assay. Detection of mutation is depended on sample integrity and the amount of amplifiable DNA present in the specimen. The methods used in this assay are highly selective and, depending on the total amount of DNA present, can detect approximately 1-5% of mutant in background of wild-type genomic DNA. See report MNR17-000235 for further information. Analytical Results: Assay Type     Detection Parameters   Result Gene Mutation Analysis   Codons 12 and 13   Negative - not Detected Perry Chan, Ph.D., MBA Methodology: DNA is isolated from FFPE specimen. DNA analysis of the mutations in the KRAS gene is performed using ARMS and Scorpions technology. This FDA approved KRAS assay is a real-time qualitative PCR assay used on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument for the detection of seven most common somatic mutations in the human KRAS oncogene, using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue. This assay is intended to aid in the identification of CRC patients for treatment with Erbitux (cetuximab) based on a KRAS no mutation detected test result. The presence of these mutations correlates with a lack of response for certain EGFR inhibitor cancer therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Mutations: Gly12Asp (35G>A), Gly12Ala (35G>C), Gly12Val (35G>T), Gly12Ser (34G>A), Gly12Arg (34G>C), Gly12Cys (34G>T), Gly13Asp (38G>A). References: 1. Janne PA, Engelman JA, Johnson BE.

NRAS Mutation Detection by PCR-SNAPSHOT Analysis INTERPRETATION:    Positive - NRAS mutation was detected in exon 2 Gly13Asp (38G>A) Indication for Study:   Adenocarcinoma Specimen Type:     Paraffin-Embedded Tissue-Colon Comments: Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory findings for the most accurate interpretation. Samples with results reported as \"no mutation detected\" may harbor NRAS mutations that are not detected by the assay. NRAS is a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein involved in downstream receptor signaling which is critical for cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Mutations in the NRAS oncogene are frequently found in human cancers. They are seen in melanoma (\\R\\18%), colorectal cancer (\\R\\2%), hematopoietic and lymphoid cancer (\\R\\10%), and thyroid cancer (8%). This assay will detect NRAS mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 (see mutation list below). NRAS mutations may predict lack of response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapies (cetuximab and panitumumab) in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Recent NCCN guidelines have recommended this treatment be given only to patients who are negative for both KRAS and NRAS mutations. Thus, these drugs are not recommended for the treatment in patients who harbor NRAS mutations. NRAS mutations are found in approximately 1-6% of colorectal cancer. See Molecular report MKF17-000132 for further information.

Exons 2, 3 and 4 of the NRAS gene were subjected to SNaPshot multiplex PCR and primer extension for mutation detection. This assay is able to detect 5% mutation in a background of wild-type DNA. Intended Use: The detection of a NRAS mutation aids in identification of patients with worse prognosis and who may not respond to certain cancer therapies. References: 1.

Received fresh for gross consultation, labeled \"Jones-rectum and sigmoid\" is a 24 cm segment of colon ranging in circumference from approximately 5.5 cm up to approximately 7 cm. The attached mesentery runs the proximal 17 cm of the specimen. At the distal aspect, the mesorectum grossly appears complete. The proximal aspect is patent and the distal aspect is stapled. The radial margin is inked black and the specimen is opened along the antimesenteric aspect to reveal a tan-gray ulcerative mass with raised borders measuring approximately 2.8 x 2.3 x 0.3 cm, located approximately 4 cm from the distal resection margin and approximately 20 cm from the proximal aspect. Grossly, the mass appears to be located approximately 0.8 cm from the nearest black inked radial margin. Additionally, the specimen reveals 2 nonpigmented apparent sessile polyps, each measuring approximately 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm, located 3 cm and 4.5 cm from the proximal margin. Both polyps appear confined to the mucosal surface. The mesenteric aspect displays two roughened areas (inked green) measuring 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.1 cm and 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm. The attached fatty tissue is palpated to reveal 17 possible lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1-proximal resection margin, en face, A2 and A3-distal resection margin, en face, A4-A20-mass described above in its entirety (A5 through A20, every 2 cassettes is one full-thickness section, bisected (blue ink-distal and green ink-proximal, for orientation purposes only, not true margin)), A21-polyps described above in their entirety, A22-roughened mesenteric areas described above, bisected in their entirety, A 23-5 lymph nodes, A24-8 lymph nodes, A25-4 lymph nodes B. Received in formalin, labeled \"Jones-distal anastomotic ring\" is a 1.9 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm tan-brown glistening ragged tissue fragment. The specimen displays a silver metallic staple line. The staple line is removed, and the tissue is submitted entirely in cassette B1. C. Received in formalin, labeled \"Jones-proximal anastomotic ring\" is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm TM-gray glistening ragged tissue fragment. The specimen displays a silver metallic staples and black suture material. The sutures and staples are removed, and the tissue is submitted entirely in cassette C1.\n\n\nPayment procedure\n\nCPT                            .88309 88304 88304 88329 88342 88341 88341 88341 81275 88381 81479 81311\n\n\n"
