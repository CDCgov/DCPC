The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the\n gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina\n NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq\n Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of\n 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic\n sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All\n sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the\n following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but\n rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with\n other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents\n that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer.
