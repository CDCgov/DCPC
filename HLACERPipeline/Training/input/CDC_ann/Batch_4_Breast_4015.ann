(JSP)\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - Left breast mass\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\nBreast, left, 2 o'clock, core biopsy:   Infiltrating mammary carcinoma with lobular type features, intermediate grade by     combined histologic grading (nuclei=2 , architecture=3 , mitoses=1 ;     Combined Nottingham score= 6/9).   5 of 6 cores involved by infiltrating carcinoma.   Longest segment of tumor involvement=5.5 mm.   Atypical lobular hyperplasia/LCIS with pagetoid ductal spread present.   Rare non-neoplastic associated calcifications identified.   No lymphovascular invasion identified.   Prognostic markers: Results to be reported separately.\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nHormone Receptor report: Immunostains show the neoplastic cells are positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors.

FISH Comments - The HER2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) did not reveal amplification of the HER2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 1.26 and a Her2 copy number of 2.12, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. There was no evidence of polysomy/polyploidy or genetic heterogeneity. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
