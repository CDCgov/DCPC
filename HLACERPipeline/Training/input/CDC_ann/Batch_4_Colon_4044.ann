The 1st smaller segment measures 8.0 cm in length with an average circumference of 5.2 cm. Along 1 end is suture material that is approximately 3.0 cm from the nearest margin, this margin will be inked black. Attached to the segment is a portion of lobulated fatty omentum radiating in measurement up to 10.7 cm. The mucosal folds exposed are pink-tan and arranged in a somewhat haphazard fashion. The wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. No polyps or lesions are grossly identified. The larger segment of colon appears to grossly be consistent with rectum and displays a mostly complete mesorectal envelope. The segment measures 15.5 cm in length with an average circumference of 4.5 cm and contains bilateral stapled margins. Attached to the segment is a portion of lobulated fatty omentum that radiates up to 23.0 cm in maximum dimension. The exposed mucosa is pink-tan and arranged in a haphazard fashion. Centrally located is a pink-tan centrally ulcerated mass, 4.5 x 3.2 cm. The mass is located 6.0 cm from the presumed proximal margin and 4.6 cm from the presumed distal margin. Upon sectioning, the mass ranges in thickness from 0.6 cm up to 1.1 cm with possible gross invasion into the underlying wall. The mass is approximately 1.5 cm from the nearest resected radial margin. Please note upon sectioning the radial margin fragments into multiple pieces. The wall of the segment of colon measures 0.2 cm in thickness. Sectioning of the surrounding fatty tissue reveals a 0.1 cm in greatest dimension pink-tan lymph node. No firm areas or implants are found upon sectioning the omentum. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A, margins from smaller segment of colon (black inked section is adjacent to suture found on colon (2/1); 1B, margins from larger segment of colon (black inked section is presumed distal margin), 2/1; 1C, mass with underlying fatty tissue and presumed gross invasion into underlying wall, 1/1; 1D, fragmented sections of blue inked radial margin from section 1C, 2/1; 1E, additional section of mass with gross wall invasion, 1/1; 1F, additional sections of blue inked radial margin, M/1; 1G-1J, representative sections of mass with adjacent mucosa (1J contains a section with blue inked adjacent serosa), 1/1 each; 1K, 1 lymph node bisected, 2/1; 1L-1S, sections of vessels with adjacent fatty tissue, 1L 2/1, 1M-1S M/1 each. (TTC) Postfixation in O-fixative, the mesenteric fat is further sectioned and palpated revealing multiple additional possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. The additional possible lymph nodes are each entirely submitted as follows: 1T, 2 possible lymph nodes, each bisected, inked for differentiation and entirely submitted, 1U, 3 possible lymph nodes, each intact, 1V-1X, 4 possible lymph nodes per cassette, each intact.
