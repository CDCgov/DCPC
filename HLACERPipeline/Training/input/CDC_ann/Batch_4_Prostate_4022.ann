Received in formalin labeled \", bilateral pelvic lymph nodes\" is a 7.3 x 6.2 x 1.5 cm aggregate of tan-yellow lobulated adipose tissue. Palpating the fatty tissue reveals multiple palpable lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A, possible intact nodes, 3/1; 1B-1D, each contain 1 bisected node, 2/1 each; 1E-1H, 1 sectioned lymph node, 1/1 each; 2. Received in formalin labeled \", prostate\" is a 40 g prostatectomy specimen. The prostate measures 5.0 cm transversely, 3.6 cm from superior to inferior, and 3.9 cm from anterior to posterior. The capsule is tan-pink, and multifocally shaggy. The right seminal vesicle measures 2.0 cm in length x 1.0 cm in diameter, and the right vas deferens measures 2.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The left seminal vesicle measures 0.8 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter, and the left vas deferens measures 2.5 cm in length x 0.6 cm in diameter. The right half of the specimen is inked in blue, and the left half is inked in orange. Serial sectioning reveals tan-pink, glistening cut surfaces with a mild amount of periurethral nodularity. No discrete lesions are identified grossly. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 2A, right seminal vesicle and vas deferens 2/1; 2B, left seminal vesicle and vas deferens, 2/1; 2C, right apical margin, 4/1; 2D, left apical margin, 4/1; 2E-2K, right side of prostate from apex to base 1/1 each; 2L-2R, left side of prostate from apex to base is 1/1 each; 2S, right base margin, 5/1; 2T, left base margin, 4/1.

Lymph nodes, bilateral, excision:     Metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma involving 1 of 6 lymph nodes.     See comments. 2. Prostate, seminal vesicles, and vasa deferentia, radical prostatectomy:     Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+5=9 (Grade Group 5).     Non-focal extraprostatic extension is identified.     The tumor focally involves the margin.     The seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia are negative for tumor.

Bilateral pelvic nodes 2. Prostate\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - 1. Multiple foci of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma are identified and are highlighted by a CK 8/18 stain. A p501 stain is negative, but the morphology and the findings in the radical prostatectomy specimen are most consistent with metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma. The largest single focus of metastatic carcinoma measures approximately 2 mm. Some of the foci are centered in the capsule of the lymph node with focal extension into the adjacent fibroadipose tissue. 2. Dominant nodule: Gleason 4+5=9 involving both sides of the prostate extending from apex to base. The tumor is associated with intraductal carcinoma. Margins: The dominant tumor nodule focally involves the apical margin and a peripheral margin anteriorly towards the apex of the prostate on the left side. The overall sum length of positive margin is approximately 1 mm. The highest Gleason grade at the margin is Gleason grade 4. Tumor also focally approaches the bladder neck margin. Tumor Extent: The tumor demonstrates non-focal extraprostatic extension on the right side laterally in the mid portion of the prostate. Non-focal extraprostatic extension also is identified on the left side posterolaterally in the mid and base of the prostate. The seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia are negative for tumor. Lymphatic invasion is present. Overall, the tumor involves approximately 70% of the prostatic volume. Gleason scores can be grouped and range from Grade Group 1 (most favorable) to Grade Group 5 (least favorable).\n\n\n"
