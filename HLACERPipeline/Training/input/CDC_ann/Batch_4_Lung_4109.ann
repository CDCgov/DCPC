Right upper lobe mass (Frozen) 2. Right upper lobe, lung\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - Sections of the right upper lobe mass demonstrate an invasive non-small cell carcinoma. The tumor cells infiltrate in sheets and nests with moderate gland formation. Immunohistochemical stains with appropriate controls are performed. The tumor cells are positive for napsin A and monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (mCEA). In addition, tumor cells exhibit nuclear staining for thyroid transcription factor (TTF-1). The tumor cells are negative for cytokeratin 5/6 and lack nuclear staining for p63. An elastic stain is performed on sections of the tumor to evaluate for visceral pleura invasion. These stains demonstrate focal disruption of the visceral pleural elastic layer by tumor consistent with focal pleural invasion. The morphologic and immunohistochemical findings are consistent with a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with focal visceral pleura invasion. The case has been reviewed by Dr. Rebecca who concurs with the diagnosis. Portions of the tumor will be submitted for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and PD-L1 testing with separate reports to follow. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis detected no evidence of an ALK (2p23) gene rearrangement. However, 6 additional copies of ALK were observed in 6% of the cells, consistent with amplification of the 2p23 chromosome region. Amplification of ALK has been suggested in some studies to be associated with a better clinical outcome in patients treated with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as crizotinib.   FISH analysis revealed no break-apart signal pattern specific for ROS1 (6q22.1) gene rearrangement. However, 1-5 additional copies of ROS1 were observed in 73% of the cells. According to a study by Jin, Y et al. (see references below) ROS1 gene copy number gain (CNG) was found in 4.8 % of cases. ROS1 gene CNG was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS, 12 vs. 58 months; p=0.003) and shorter overall survival (OS, 40 vs. 67 months; p <0.001) than the group without CNG. Additional copies of ROS1 gene is an independent poor prognostic factor.   Monitoring for these abnormalities may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.   It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with other clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  ALK Breakapart (5`ALK; 3`ALK) - FDA Approved (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  ROS1 Breakapart (5`ROS1; 3`ROS1) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)   References:  Nat Med. 2012 Feb 12;18(3):382-4; Oncol Rep. 2012 Oct;28(4):1187-92; J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1667-74.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer.

This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: portions of exons 18-21, consisting of codons 699-726, 729-840, 848-869 (specifically including codons E709, G719, S768, T790, L833, L858, L861 and deletions and insertions in exons 19 and 20). <BR/><BR/>Paez, J.
