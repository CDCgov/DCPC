The tumor shows a combined Nottingham score of 5, with scores of 3 for tubule formation, 1 for nuclear pleomorphism, and 1 for mitotic activity. Ancillary hormone receptor studies are pending, and will be reported separately as an addendum. Preliminary findings were communicated to Candye Hutson at 3:20 pm on 08/29/2017. FISH Comments - The HER-2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) revealed amplification of the HER-2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 2.24 and a Her2 copy number of 4.84, (ratio greater or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number >6) indicating amplification.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
