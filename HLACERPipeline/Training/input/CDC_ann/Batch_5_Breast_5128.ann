An addendum will be followed when the results are available. \n\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nPLEASE REPLACE THE ORIGINAL REPORT WITH THE SAME ACCESSION NUMBER, WITH THIS REPORT. \n \nThis case was sent to Dr. Elavathil at Juravinski HOSPITAL, 711 Concession Street, HOSPITAL, \nOntario, for her expert opinion. Her report is as follows. \n \n A. LEFT BREAST REEXCISION: As per your gross description I understand the specimen \n measured 2.7 cm medial to lateral x5.6 cm superior to inferior and 4.3 cm anterior to \n posterior. The margins were painted and the specimen was serially sectioned and \n submitted in toto in blocks 1-23. A gross diagram was also available for review. \n   \n Your H\\T\\E sections show previous biopsy cavity with fat necrosis. In addition I concur \n with you, there is invasive duct carcinoma NOS, grade 1 present in block number A1, \n A2 and A3. Since these sections are consecutive sections, the size of the \n invasive carcinoma = 12.9 mm. The adjacent breast tissue shows focal ductal carcinoma \n in situ changes and focal lobular carcinoma in situ changes. Florid usual ductal \n hyperplasia is also noted. \n   \n The cautery artifacts present limits proper assessment of the margin. There is some \n ink carryover also present. Hence I find it difficult to assess the margin. Hence \n this margin assessment is best determined by you. \n   \n B. LEFT SENTINEL NODE EXCISION:  \n   \n I concur with you, the lymph node shows metastatic duct carcinoma, which appears \n similar in morphology as specimen A. The size of this metastasis measures 3 mm. \n There is no evidence of extranodal extension. \n   \n Note: The morphological features of this invasive carcinoma is different from the \n microinvasive carcinoma from the previous specimen. \n   \n The HER-2/neu slides are also reviewed by 2 of the HER-2/neu reporting pathologist \n who concurs the HER-2/neu is negative (1+). \n  \n \nCANCER CASE BIOMARKERS      \n AJCC/UICC                              CAP Version: Jan 2015 \n  \n               BREAST: Biomarker Reporting Template \n  \n Test(s) Performed \n Estrogen Receptor (ER) Status                \n Progesterone Receptor (PgR) Status             \n HER2 by Immunohistochemistry (IHC)             \n  \n   (ER) Results: Positive                    Block B16        \n \n    Percentage of Cells with Nuclear Positivity: Specify %     \n     60   \n   Primary Antibody: Other (specify) \n    ER EP1                                 \n  \n   (PgR) Results: Positive                      Block B16      \n   \n    Percentage of Cells with Nuclear Positivity: Specify %     \n     50   \n   Primary Antibody: PgR 636     \n  \n   HER2 IHC Results: Negative (Score 1+)             Block B16    \n   Percentage of Cells with Uniform Intense Complete Membrane Staining: 0   \n   Primary Antibody: HercepTest (A0485) \n  \n Cold Ischemia and Fixation Times: \n Meet requirements specified in latest version of the ASCO/CAP      \n  \n Fixative: Formalin \n \n               BREAST: Biomarker Reporting Template \n  \n Test(s) Performed \n Estrogen Receptor (ER) Status                \n Progesterone Receptor (PgR) Status             \n HER2 by Immunohistochemistry (IHC)             \n  \n   (ER) Results: Positive                    Block B2         \n \n    Percentage of Cells with Nuclear Positivity: Specify %     \n     95   \n   Primary Antibody: Other (specify) \n    ER EP1                                 \n  \n   (PgR) Results: Positive                       Block B2      \n   \n    Percentage of Cells with Nuclear Positivity: Specify %     \n     90   \n   Primary Antibody: 636       \n  \n   HER2 IHC Results: Negative (Score 1+)             Block B2     \n   Percentage of Cells with Uniform Intense Complete Membrane Staining: 0   \n   Primary Antibody: HercepTest    \n  \n Cold Ischemia and Fixation Times: \n Meet requirements specified in latest version of the ASCO/CAP    \n  \n Fixative: Formalin     \n  \n  Comment(s): H                                    \n  \nDIAGNOSIS            \n A.

Elavathil\n\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nInternal Consultation with: Dr. K. Chorneyko\n\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nThe entire specimen is submitted for microscopic evaluation. Histological examination shows \ninvasive ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma in situ. The invasive ductal carcinoma is \nmodified SRB grade 1 (tubule formation: 1, nuclear pleomorphism: 2, mitosis:1, with a total \nscore of 4).  \n \nThe size of invasive ductal carcinoma is difficult to measure as there is no discrete mass \non gross examination. Microscopic foci of invasive ductal carcinoma are present in blocks \nA1, A2, and A3 (slices 1, 2 and 3). Given they are contiguous slices and the invasive \ncarcinoma appears to be at similar location in each slice, I favor this is a single focus of \ninvasive carcinoma. Given each slice measuring 4.3 mm in average thickness, the size of the \ninvasive carcinoma estimates approximately 12.9mm in greatest dimension.  \n \nThe superior resection margin is markedly cauterized. Although there is no definite in situ \nand invasive malignancy at the margin, marked cautery artifact makes the evaluation \ndifficult. Clinical correlation is recommended.  \n \n\n\n\n"
