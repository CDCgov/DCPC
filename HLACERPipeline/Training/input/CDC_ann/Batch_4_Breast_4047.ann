Breast, left, stereotactic biopsy:     Determinate microcalcifications identified as coarse stromal calcifications, with a       single focus of remote fat necrosis with fibrosis, negative for atypical       hyperplasia and malignancy. 2. Breast, right mass 10-o'clock stereotactic biopsy:     Infiltrating mammary carcinoma, no special type (ductal), intermediate combined       histologic grade.     Tumor involves multiple submitted cores and is at least 15 mm in greatest       dimension.     No lymphovascular invasion identified.     Hormone receptor and HER-2 studies along with E-cadherin will be performed       and reported as an addendum.\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nHormone Receptor report: Neoplastic cells are POSITIVE for nuclear estrogen receptor. Neoplastic cells are POSITIVE for nuclear progesterone receptor. Neoplastic cells show NO IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE (Score 0) of HER-2 overexpression, HER-2 status will be confirmed by FISH.

A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 1.08 and a Her2 copy number of 2.20, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. There was no evidence of polysomy/polyploidy or genetic heterogeneity. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
