Specimen 1 is labeled \"left sentinel node biopsy - 1803\" on both the requisition and the container. Received in formalin is 1 candidate lymph node, 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm. There is adherent fatty tissue. Cut surfaces of the lymph node display widespread blue discoloration. The lymph node is totally submitted in cassette 1A. 2. Specimen 2 is labeled \"left breast suture at medial\" on both the requisition and the container. Received in formalin is a 1098 g left breast, 21.0 x 14.6 x up to 8.5 cm. The specimen is superficially bound by an ellipse of tan skin, 15.5 x up to 11.8 cm. A suture marks the medial tip of the skin ellipse. There is an everted nipple, 1.1 x 1.0 cm. Lateral and superior to the nipple is a partially healed previous incision, 3.8 cm in length. The skin displays areas of blue discoloration, consistent with injection for sentinel node studies. The skin displays a tan-brown macule, 0.4 cm in maximum dimension. The posterior margin displays adherent tagged soft skeletal muscle. Prior to sectioning, all margins are inked black. Sectioning in the lateral aspect of the breast reveals a biopsy cavity, 8.8 x 6.4 cm in flattened dimensions, which contains serosanguineous fluid. The biopsy cavity grossly extends to within 1.3 cm of the superior margin, to within 1.8 cm of the inferior margin, and to within 0.9 cm of the posterior margin. The biopsy cavity is present in the upper outer and lower outer quadrants. Sectioning through the remainder of the breast reveals fatty and fibrous tissue with a firm focus of pale tan tissue, 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm, in the lower outer quadrant, grossly extending to within 0.3 cm of the posterior margin. No other masses are seen. Section summary:   2A, nipple and skin taken outside of macule.   2B, skin at healing incision.   2C-D, posterior aspect of biopsy cavity, sections include posterior margin.   2E-F, anterior aspect of biopsy cavity.   2G, superior aspect of biopsy cavity.   2H, inferior aspect of biopsy cavity.   2I, medial aspect of biopsy cavity.   2J, lateral aspect of biopsy cavity.   2K, superior margin.   2L, inferior margin.   2M-N, palpably firm area in lower inner quadrant, sections include posterior margin.   2O, lower inner quadrant.   2P, upper inner quadrant.   2Q, upper outer quadrant.   2R, lower outer quadrant.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\n1.

Left breast (total mastectomy):     No residual invasive ductal carcinoma identified, biopsy cavity noted in the       upper and lower outer quadrants.     Original tumor 9 mm, grade 2.     There is extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, solid, comedo, and cribriform with       focal comedo necrosis, nuclear grade 2, present in association with the       biopsy cavity and additional foci in the lower inner quadrant.     DCIS measures approximately 2.5 cm in aggregate including the prior excisional       biopsy.     All margins of resection are negative for invasive carcinoma.     Margins of rsection are negative for DCIS, closest margin is 1 mm, posterior.     Microcalcifications seen in association with DCIS in non-neoplastic tissue.
