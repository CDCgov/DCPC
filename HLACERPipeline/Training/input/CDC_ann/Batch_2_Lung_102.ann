Using the automated Ventana stainer, tissu is incubated with the designated antibody which is then localized by a non-biotin, dual polymer detection system. The controls are reviewed for appropriate reactivity and found to be adequate. Results on the target cel population are indicated below: Some of the immunohistochemistry stains reported below were developed and their performance characteristics determined by LabCorp, Inc. They have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, although such approval is not required for analyte-specific reagents of this type. ANTIBODIES (CLONE) TO: RESULTS: CDX-2 (88) - negative CK 7 (OV-TL12/30) - positive CK 20 (SP33) - negative Napsin A (IP64) - rare weak positive Thyroid Transcription Factor-1 TTF-1 (8G7G3/1)- negative Villin (CWWB1) - positive PAX8 - negative ER - negative WT1 - negative DIAGNOSIS: The malignant cells are uniformly positive for CK 7 and villin with rare cells positive for focal Napsin. These cells are negative for CK 20, CDX2 and TTF1. Positive expression of Napsin A is suggestive of adenocarcinoma of lung origin. Negative expression of CK20 and CDX2 argue against metastatic GI/colon primary. Negative expression of PAX8 and WT1 argue against genitourinary primary and negative ER argues against breast primary.

PLEASE SEE COMMENT. 11/26/2015 KC Results-Comments Uniform positive expression of CK7 with Villin and rare cells weakly positive for Napsin A is supportive of the above impression. Cells are negative for TTF1 and enteric type lung carcinomas usually are negative. These slides were reviewed by Dr. who concurs with the above interpretation.

Histologically, core biopsies show scar tissue associated with infiltratin non-small cell carcinoma, morphologically consistent with adenocarcinoma.

Addendum Comment {Not Entered} ***Electronically Signed Out*** Addendum SPI Addendum Diagnosis FISH Report ALK Analysis RESULT: No Evidence of ALK Gene Rearrangement Detected by FISH nuc ish(ALKx2)[50] INTERPRETATION: FISH analysis was performed on paraffin embedded tissue using an ALK Break Apart DNA probe (FDA approved kit, Abbott Molecular Inc) for the detection of rearrangements involving the AL gene. Fifty interphase nuclei were examined and no evidence of ALK gene specific abnormalities associated wit non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was detected. Genetic changes other than those assayed here cannot be ruled out on the basis of this testing. Correlation with clinical and pathological findings is suggested for a complete interpretation of the results. See Molecular report for further information. Addendum Comment Please see Integrated Oncology Report for complete details. ***Electronically Signed Out*** Addendum SPI Addendum Diagnosis EGFR Gene Mutation Analysis INTERPRETATION: Negative for EGFR Mutation. Comments: No mutations were detected within the analyzed region of the EGF gene in the sample provided for analysis. Less than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory findings for the most accurate interpretation. A subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has shown clinical responsiveness to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors gefitinib (IRESSA) and erlotinib (Tarceva), including never smokers, individuals of Asian ethnicity, and those with adenocarcinoma histology. In the majority of patients with highly responsive tumors, the tumor contains a somatic mutation within the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. The presence of a somatic EGFR mutation is significantly associated with response to gefitinib and erlotinib, and is strongly predictive of prolonged survival in NSCLC patients.
