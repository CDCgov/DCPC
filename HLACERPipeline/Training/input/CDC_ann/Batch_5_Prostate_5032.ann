PROSTATE BIOPSY - RIGHT BASE: Sections demonstrate several cores of tissue with circumscribed sheets, nests and aggregates of tumor cells with indistinct cytoplasmic borders, scant amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei with an evenly dispersed chromatin pattern. Nuclear \"molding\" is seen. Perineural invasion is identified (Level 5). Tumor is seen within bundles of smooth muscle, suspicious, but not definitive for, extracapsular extension. Lymphovascular invasion is not identified. Benign prostatic glands are not seen.\n\nThe tumor cells demonstrate cytoplasmic immunopositivity for synaptophysin and are negative for both chromogranin and PSA.\n\nThe histological and immunohistochemical findings are a small cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma. Although metastases of small cell carcinoma to the prostate from other sites may be considered, the presence of typical adenocarcinoma in other sites (see Part B) favors a prostatic primary. Clinical pathological and radiological correlation is recommended.\n\nThis case has been reviewed by both Dr. D. Melega and Dr. N. Juneja who concur with the histological and immunohistochemical assessment and diagnosis of a small cell carcinoma.\n\nB. PROSTATE BIOPSY - RIGHT MID: Sections demonstrate three (3) cores of tissue completely effaced by nests, aggregates and individual tumor cells with similar morphological features to that described in Part A. In a solitary focus, neoplastic glands without a dual cell layer are seen. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion are not seen. Uninvolved prostatic glands are not identified.\n\nThe tumor cells demonstrate cytoplasmic immunopositivity for synaptophysin and are negative for both chromogranin and PSA. In situ lesions are surrounded by a basal cell layer identified immunohistochemically.\n\nThe histological and immunohistochemical findings are a small cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma with a focus of traditional adenocarcinoma. Although metastases of small cell carcinoma to the prostate from other sites may be considered, the presence of typical adenocarcinoma favors a prostatic primary. Clinical pathological and radiological correlation is recommended.\n\nThis case has been reviewed by both Dr. D. Melega who concurs with the histological and immunohistochemical assessment and diagnosis of a small cell carcinoma with a small focus of traditional adenocarcinoma of the prostate.\n\nC.

As such, a Gleason's score is not assigned to these respective lesions. \n\n\nDoug:\n\n\nRUSH CASE....49 yo\n\nPROSTATE BIOPSY - RIGHT BASE: Sections demonstrate several cores of tissue with circumscribed sheets, nests and aggregates of tumor cells with indistinct cytoplasmic borders, scant amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei with an evenly dispersed chromatin pattern. Nuclear \"molding\" is seen. Perineural invasion is identified (Level 5). Tumor is seen within bundles of smooth muscle, consistent with extracapsular extension. Lymphovascular invasion is not identified. Benign prostatic glands are not seen.\n\nThe tumor cells demonstrate cytoplasmic immunopositivity for synaptophysin and are negative for both chromogranin and PSA.\n\nThe histological and immunohistochemical findings are a small cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma. Although metastases of small cell carcinoma to the prostate from other sites may be considered, the presence of in situ lesions with an intact basal cell layer, immunohistochemcially, favors a prostatic primary.\n\nB. PROSTATE BIOPSY - RIGHT MID: Sections demonstrate three (3) cores of tissue completely effaced by nests, aggregates and individual tumor cells with similar morphological features to that described in Part A. In a solitary focus, neoplastic glands without a dual cell layer are seen. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion are not seen. Uninvolved prostatic glands are not identified.\n\nThe tumor cells demonstrate cytoplasmic immunopositivity for synaptophysin and are negative for both chromogranin and PSA.
