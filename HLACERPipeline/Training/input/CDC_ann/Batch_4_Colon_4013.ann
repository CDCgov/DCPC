Received in formalin labeled \", sigmoid colectomy\" is an 11.5 cm in length x 2.7 cm in diameter portion of colon with 1 stapled end and 1 opened end. The serosal surface is tan-pink, glistening with a focal area of puckering and a small amount of attached pericolic fat. The serosal surface is inked in black. The specimen is open to reveal a tan-pink, glistening, edematous mucosa with normal colonic folds. The 5.5 x 4.7 x 0.6 cm pink-purple, lobular, ulcerated circumferential lesion is identified. The lesion is 3.5 cm from the open margin, 5.5 cm from the stapled margin, and 9.0 cm from the radial margin. Sectioning the lesion reveals gross invasion of the bowel wall. The lesion comes to within less than 0.1 cm of the black inked margin. A focal area of possible invasion into the fatty tissue is also identified. A lymph node dissection reveals multiple possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.3-1.0 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A, open margin, 1/1; 1B, stapled margin, 1/1; 1C, radial margin, 1/1; 1D-1F, central sections of lesion, 1/1 each; 1G-1H, possible intact nodes, G, 4/1, H, 5/1; 1I, one sectioned node, 3/1. Additional cassettes: 1J-1K, possible intact node, J, 6/1; K, 3/1. (jh9) 2. Received in formalin labeled \", anastomotic donuts\" are 2 rings of mucosal tissue measuring 1.3 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm, and 1.7 x 1.5 x 0.9 cm. The mucosal surface of each fragment is tan-pink and diffusely hyperemic. No lesions are identified. Representative sections are submitted in cassette 2A, 2/1.

Sigmoid colon, sigmoid colectomy:     Well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (5.5 cm in size).     The tumor invades into the pericolonic adipose tissue.     Focus suspicious for lymphovascular invasion.     Negative for definite perineural invasion.     Distal, proximal and radial margins, negative for dysplasia and malignancy.     Pericolonic lymph nodes, negative for metastatic carcinoma (0/16); however,      one lymph node with isolated tumor cluster is noted.     See comment. 2. Colon, anastomotic donuts:     Viable colonic walls (x 2), negative for dysplasia and malignancy.

Sigmoid colectomy 2. Anastamosis donut\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - 1. On slide 1I, there is a single cluster of around 10-15 cells measuring less than 0.2 mm present within the subcapsular sinus of the lymph node, both noted on H and E and (more prominently), on a cytokeratin AE1/AE3 stain. Per the AJCC Cancer Staging manual (8th Edition, 2017), this focus is considered an isolated tumor cluster (ITC), and not included in the total positive lymph node count (N0). Because the biologic significance of ITCs (either a single focus in a single node, multiple foci within a single or multiple nodes) remains unproven, N0 is considered justified. Appropriate clinical follow up is recommended. Molecular studies are not currently performed, but may be performed, if requested. Please contact Pathology.\n\n\n"
