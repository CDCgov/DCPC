Received fresh for gross consultation, labeled \"Jones-rectum and sigmoid\" is a 24 cm segment of colon ranging in circumference from approximately 5.5 cm up to approximately 7 cm. The attached mesentery runs the proximal 17 cm of the specimen. At the distal aspect, the mesorectum grossly appears complete. The proximal aspect is patent and the distal aspect is stapled. The radial margin is inked black and the specimen is opened along the antimesenteric aspect to reveal a tan-gray ulcerative mass with raised borders measuring approximately 2.8 x 2.3 x 0.3 cm, located approximately 4 cm from the distal resection margin and approximately 20 cm from the proximal aspect. Grossly, the mass appears to be located approximately 0.8 cm from the nearest black inked radial margin. Additionally, the specimen reveals 2 nonpigmented apparent sessile polyps, each measuring approximately 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm, located 3 cm and 4.5 cm from the proximal margin. Both polyps appear confined to the mucosal surface. The mesenteric aspect displays two roughened areas (inked green) measuring 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.1 cm and 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.1 cm. The attached fatty tissue is palpated to reveal 17 possible lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1-proximal resection margin, en face, A2 and A3-distal resection margin, en face, A4-A20-mass described above in its entirety (A5 through A20, every 2 cassettes is one full-thickness section, bisected (blue ink-distal and green ink-proximal, for orientation purposes only, not true margin)), A21-polyps described above in their entirety, A22-roughened mesenteric areas described above, bisected in their entirety, A 23-5 lymph nodes, A24-8 lymph nodes, A25-4 lymph nodes B. Received in formalin, labeled \"Jones-distal anastomotic ring\" is a 1.9 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm tan-brown glistening ragged tissue fragment. The specimen displays a silver metallic staple line. The staple line is removed, and the tissue is submitted entirely in cassette B1. C. Received in formalin, labeled \"Jones-proximal anastomotic ring\" is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm TM-gray glistening ragged tissue fragment. The specimen displays a silver metallic staples and black suture material. The sutures and staples are removed, and the tissue is submitted entirely in cassette C1.\n\n\n"
