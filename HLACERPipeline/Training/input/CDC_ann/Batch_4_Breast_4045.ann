A ratio of average HER-2 signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17, CEP 17, signals was 1.26 and a Her2 copy number of 3.64, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. Genetic heterogeneity was observed in 8% of scattered cells. The significance of this finding and the impact on treatment response is currently unknown. Clinical correlation is recommended.\n \n  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.\n  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.\n  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.\n \n  Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution.
