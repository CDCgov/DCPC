The differential includes intraductal papilloma with florid hyperplasia. Final diagnosis on this is deferred for the definitive excision specimen. Hormone receptor and HER2 studies on the invasive carcinoma are pending and will be reported separately. My colleague Dr. Wayne Lennington has reviewed this case and concurs with the diagnosis. Results were discussed with Dr. Vanwinkle at 2 PM on 09/06/2017. FISH Comments - The HER2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) did not reveal amplification of the HER2 oncogene. A ratio of average HER-2 signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17, CEP 17, signals was 1.55 and a Her2 copy number of 2.48, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4), indicating absence of amplification. Genetic heterogeneity was observed in 24% of scattered cells. The significance of this finding and the impact on treatment response is currently unknown. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater than or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater than or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.   Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumors fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.   FISH analysis was performed on 25 interphase cells with the PathVysion HER-2 DNA Probe Kit (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) using an automated analysis system. This test has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for detecting amplification of the HER-2/neu gene via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human breast cancer tissue specimens. The performance characteristics of this assay have been determined by Pathgroup, Inc. Performance characteristics refer to the analytical performance of the test. Updates to Her2 result interpretation have been made per 2013 ASCO-CAP Her2 Test Guideline Recommendation.\n\n\n"
