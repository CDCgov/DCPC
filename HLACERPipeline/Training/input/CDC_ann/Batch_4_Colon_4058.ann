Entirely submitted. 1A-1C, 1/1 each. 2. Received in formalin labeled \", sigmoid\" is an unoriented portion of colon measuring 16.0 cm in length and 2.6 cm in diameter. There is a 5.0 x 4.8 x 1.0 cm circumferential mass at the mid portion, 4.0 cm from the nearest resection margin, 5.5 cm from the opposite margin, and 0.6 cm from the mesenteric resection margin. The mass grossly extends through the bowel wall and into the overlying adipose tissue. The mass creates a puckering of the overlying serosa, although no extension through the serosa is identified. The mucosa is otherwise unremarkable, with no additional lesions identified. The bowel wall otherwise averages 0.2 cm. Multiple candidate lymph nodes are identified, up to 0.5 cm.

COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing.

This result is consistent with a competent mismatch repair function. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS).<BR/><BR/>Microsatellite Instability Analysis has multifaceted clinical utility: as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy response; as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for colorectal carcinoma; and as a genetic risk biomarker for the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome such as Lynch Syndrome.<BR/><BR/>As an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy biomarker, recent literature (Le, et al., <i>N Engl J Med</i> 372:2509-2520; Topolian, et al., <i>Nature Reviews Cancer</i> 16:275-287) indicates that, in general, patients that are Microsatellite Stable (MSS) have a poorer response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.<BR/><BR/>MSS tumors have poorer prognosis than MSI-H tumors, and better response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) adjuvant chemotherapy. <BR/><BR/>As a genetic risk biomarker, the result of MSS is inconsistent with Lynch syndrome. However, if the clinical suspicion remains high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result, consideration should be given to a genetic consult to direct additional testing. <BR/><BR/>Interpretation of this result of MSS in the context of other clinical and laboratory findings is strongly recommended.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist and representative areas of tumor and normal tissue selected. These areas were microdissected from the surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA extracted using standard methods (QIAGEN QIASymphony). The tumor and normal DNA were separately PCR amplified for five microsatellite markers (NR-21, BAT-26, BAT-25, NR-24 and MONO-27; Promega Corp.), and size fractionated via capillary electrophoresis (Life Technologies 3500xl). The tumor and normal profiles were compared to determine the presence of altered microsatellite profiles. The analytic sensitivity of the assay is approximately 10-20% and is dependent on the size and clonality of any instability. The presence of instability in less than 10-20% of the DNA examined will not be detected. This assay uses reagents that may be marked as Research Use Only or Analyte Specific Reagent. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. Portions of this test use reagents designated by the manufacturer as for research use, not for clinical use. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. <BR/><BR/>Klump B,et al. <i>Int J Colorectal Dis</i> Vol 19:23-42, 2004; Grady WM.<i>Cancer Metastasis Rev</i> Vol 23:11-27, 2004; Umar, et al., <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> Vol 96:261-268, 2004; Popat S, Hubner R, Houlston RS. <i>Prognosis J Clin Oncol</i> Vol 23(3):609-618, 2005; Ribic CM, et al.,<i> N Engl J Med.</i> Vol 349(3):247-257, 2003; D.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer.
