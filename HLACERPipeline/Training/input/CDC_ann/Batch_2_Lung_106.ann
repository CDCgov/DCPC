Integrated Oncology is a business unit of Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings. This assay has not been validated on decalcified tissues. Results should be interpreted with caution if this specimen was decalcified given the liklihood of false negativity on decalcified specimens. Any image(s) that accompany this report is/are a representative image(s) only and should not be used to render a diagnosis. TEST: PD-L1 FOR KEYTRUDA INTERPRETATION: No Expression DISCLAIMER This test was performed by Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc. at 5005 S 40th Street, Ste 1100, Phoenix, AZ 85040. Integrated Oncology is a business unit of Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings. Any image(s) that accompany this report is/are a representative image(s) only and should not be used to render a diagnosis. This interpretation is contingent on the specimen and the clinical information received. Known positive cells or tissues are employed with each test and examined to ensure positivity. Positive and negative internal controls, if present, react appropriately. This analysis is an adjunct to the evaluation of the referring physician and does not represent the final diagnosis. The immunohistochemistry tests performed at Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc. were validated on tissue fixed in 10% neutral buffered foralin. The performance characteristics of the tests performed on tissue processed in other fixatives is not known. This assay has not been validated on decalcified tissues. Results should be interpreted with caution if this specimen was decalcified given the likelihood of decreased staining or false negativity on decalcified specimens.
