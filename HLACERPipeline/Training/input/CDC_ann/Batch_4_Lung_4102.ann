Transbronchial needle aspiration right upper lobe 2. Transbronchial needle aspiration 4R 3. Brush right upper lobe 4. Bronchoalveolar lavage right upper lobe\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - The aspiration biopsies (parts 1 and 2), as well as the bronchoalveolar lavage (part 4) show three-dimensional clusters of malignant epithelial cells. The malignant cells have enlarged nuclei with irregular nuclear membranes and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical stains performed on the cell block for part 2 demonstrate strong positive staining for TTF-1 and cytokeratin 7. The tumor cells are negative for cytokeratin 5/6. The findings are diagnostic for adenocarcinoma. Prognostic studies, including ALK, EGFR, ROS1, PDL-1 and BRAF, are requested on part 1 and will be reported separately. Dr. Spence has reviewed the case and concurs with the diagnosis. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis detected no evidence of an ALK (2p23) gene rearrangement. However, 1-4 additional copies of ALK were observed in 92% of the cells. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.   FISH analysis revealed no break-apart signal pattern specific for ROS1 (6q22.1) gene rearrangement. However, 1-3 additional copies of ROS1 were observed in 33% of the cells. According to a study by Jin, Y et al. (see references below) ROS1 gene copy number gain (CNG) was found in 4.8 % of cases. ROS1 gene CNG was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS, 12 vs. 58 months; p=0.003) and shorter overall survival (OS, 40 vs. 67 months; p <0.001) than the group without CNG. Additional copies of ROS1 gene is an independent poor prognostic factor.   Monitoring for these abnormalities may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.   It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with other clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  ALK Breakapart (5`ALK; 3`ALK) - FDA Approved (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  ROS1 Breakapart (5`ROS1; 3`ROS1) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)   References:  Nat Med. 2012 Feb 12;18(3):382-4; Oncol Rep. 2012 Oct;28(4):1187-92; J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1667-74.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.  This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: exons 10 and 14, consisting of codons 464 to 472 and 581 to 601 (specifically including codon V600).  <BR/><BR/>Cohen, Yoram, et al.<i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i> 95.8 (2003): 625-627.
