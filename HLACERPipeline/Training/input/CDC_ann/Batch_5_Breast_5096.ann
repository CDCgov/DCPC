The specimen has been previously oriented with a short and long suture indicating the superior and lateral, respectively. \nMain findings: There is a firm, well-circumscribed solid tan mass (13.0 x 12.4 x 8.0 cm) with focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The mass abuts the deep, superior and skin margins and is 1.0 cm from the inferior, 2.0 cm from the medial and 2.9 cm from the lateral margins. The skin overlying the mass is pink-tan, nodular with diffuse sloughing and a red-brown ulcer (3.5 x 2.5 x 0.2 cm) with overlying crust, 3.4 cm from the superior margin. \nAdditional findings / pertinent negatives: The non-tumoural breast tissue is fatty with no other lesions. There is also a well-healed scar (17.0 cm length) on the skin surface\nInk code: \nblack - superior\ngreen - inferior\nblue - deep\nSection code (representative):\n(A1) closest medial margin\n(A2-A3) mass with closest deep margin\n(A4-A5) mass with closest superior margin\n(A6) mass with closest inferior margin\n(A7-A8) skin over mass with ulcer\n(A9) closest lateral margin\n(A10-A12) representative mass. \nPhone consultation with Dr. A.B.

Only the sarcomatoid component is identified in this tissue sampling; an epithelioid carcinomatous component is not identified. The lesional cells are spindled and demonstrate prominent nuclear atypia and marked pleomorphism. Mitotic figures, including highly atypical forms, are readily identified and number greater than 20 per 10 high power fields. Multiple foci of necrosis are present throughout the tissue. The tumour extends from the dermis into the subcutis with extension to involve superficial skeletal muscle fibers of the chest wall. In keeping with the previously diagnosed metaplastic breast carcinoma with sarcomatoid features, this recurrent tumour also demonstrates patchy positive staining with antibodies against cytokeratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin CAM5.2, and p63. Smooth muscle actin and desmin immunostaining are also positive in many of the lesional cells in keeping with a sarcomatoid phenotype. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion are not identified. The margins of resection appear free of tumour but is present within <2 mm of the deep margin of resection. The submitted lymph node is negative for malignancy.\n\n\n"
