Angiolymphatic invasion is observed.   Atypical lobular hyperplasia, fibroadenomatoid nodule, and other benign changes. Immunohistochemical stains for Ki-67, p53, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and HER-2/neu have been performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. Positive and negative controls react appropriately. The results are as follows:  Estrogen Receptor (SP1): 0% of nuclei Progesterone Receptor (1E2): 0% of nuclei Ki-67 (30-9): 20-30% of nuclei (High labeling index) p53 (BP5311): 2-3+ nuclear staining, 70% of nuclei (positive) ERBB2/Her2 (4B5): 3+ (positive for overexpression); FISH pending Please see microscopic description for details.\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nFish Report: FISH - POSITIVE for HER-2 oncogene amplification by FISH analysis    ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.microscopic examination\n\nThe invasive tumor grade is based on the following combined Nottingham scoring: tubules 3, nuclei mostly 2 to focal 3, mitoses 1; total score 7 of 9. The tumor is quite discohesive and some cells have apocrine and/or histiocytoid appearances. There are foci suspicious for angiolymphatic invasion. Ductal carcinoma in situ is not observed. The background breast tissue also shows multiple foci of atypical lobular hyperplasia, a small fibroadenomatoid nodule, apocrine metaplasia, and columnar cell changes. Immunostains are performed with satisfactory positive and negative controls. E- cadherin is negative in most tumor cells, though others show weak to moderate, mostly partial staining (much less strong than normal ductal epithelial internal controls). CD31 confirms several foci of angiolymphatic invasion.  Her2/neu Immunohistochemistry Report  Block: 1  Specimen Site: right, 1:00, 8N  Specimen Type: (needle biopsy)  Fixative: Formalin  Time to fixation: Unavailable  Duration of fixation: 35 hrs  Antibody used: Clone 4B5 (Ventana), on Ventana Benchmark.

This quantitative immunohistochemical evaluation of Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 (HER-2) is performed in accordance with all current guidelines as recommended by the ASCO and CAP.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nRight breast core 1:00 - 8 cm from nipple\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nFISH Comments - The HER-2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) revealed amplification of the HER-2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 15.83 and a Her2 copy number of 18.36, (ratio greater or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number >6) indicating amplification.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin for 35hrs (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
