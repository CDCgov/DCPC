Neoplastic cells are NEGATIVE for nuclear progesterone receptor. Neoplastic cells show NO IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL EVIDENCE (Score 0) of HER-2 overexpression, HER-2 status will be confirmed by FISH. The proliferation rate is high (80%) on the Ki-67 immunohistochemical stain. COMMENT: This report is amended to correct the diagnosis field which previously stated the neoplastic cells to be \"positive\" for nuclear progesterone receptor. The tabulated data below remains unchanged.\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nFISH Comments - The HER2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) did not reveal amplification of the HER2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 1.12 and a Her2 copy number of 2.24, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. There was no evidence of polysomy/polyploidy or genetic heterogeneity. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nFish Report: FISH - NEGATIVE for HER2 oncogene amplification by FISH analysis  NEGATIVE for chromosome 17 polysomy by FISH analysis       ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - Invasive high-grade carcinoma with squamous features, C50.412 Malig neoplasm of upper-outer quadrant of left female breast\n\n\n"
