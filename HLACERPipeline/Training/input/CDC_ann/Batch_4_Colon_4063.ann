The specimen is labeled \"right colon\" on both the requisition and the container. Received in formalin is a 47 cm segment of colon, contiguous with an 8.5 cm segment of terminal ileum. There is up to 7 cm of attached fatty tissue noted over the serosa. Appendix is not present. The resected margin is closed with surgical staples. Perforation is not grossly identified. 12 cm from the distal margin, there is a lobular tan-red tumor, 2.7 x 2.3 x 0.6 cm. There is tattooing of the serosa in the area of the lesion. The lesion does not grossly involve the serosa. The lesion grossly involves 2.7 cm of the mucosal circumference. The mucosal circumference is 9.2 cm. The lesion is grossly 9.5 cm from the mesenteric cut surface. The lesion is on the antimesenteric surface of the bowel. The lesion grossly appears to involve the full- thickness of the mucosa and submucosa and to extend into the muscularis propria. There are occasional additional polyps, up to 0.6 cm in maximum dimension, which grossly extends to within 9.8 cm of the distal margin. The ileocecal valve is grossly unremarkable. The small bowel mucosa is tan and velvety and is grossly free of lesions. Sectioning through the attached fatty tissue reveals 6 candidate lymph nodes, up to 1.5 cm in maximum dimension. Each is totally submitted. Section summary:   1A, proximal margin.   1B, distal margin.   1C, mesenteric cut surface.   1D-E, tumor.   1F, polyp closest to distal margin.   1G, additional polyps.   1H, ileocecal valve.   1I, 1 bisected candidate lymph node.   1J-K, 5 candidate lymph nodes, each submitted whole.   1L-U, additional representative fatty tissue. After review of the initial sections, additional representative fatty tissue is processed in cassettes 1V-AE.

In one slide (1E), the tumor is in contact with adipose tissue where the muscularis is disrupted, though still within the contour of the muscularis, and tangential sectioning or tissue disruption cannot be entirely excluded to explain the finding. The tumor is conservatively staged at pT2. Multiple attempts at lymph node dissection were attempted, with only five ultimately recovered, all negative for tumor (pN0). Results of mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry:    - DNA mismatch repair enzymes intact (normal protein expression).    - See comment. COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue, block 1E, controls react appropriately) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be given to a genetic consult with additional testing.\n\n\n"
