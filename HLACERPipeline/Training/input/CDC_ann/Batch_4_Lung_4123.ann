There is prominent nuclear pleomorphism present. Focal gland formation is noted. Immunohistochemical stains with appropriate controls are performed. The tumor nuclei are strongly positive for thyroid transcription factor (TTF-1) and demonstrate cytoplasmic staining for monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (mCEA). Tumor nuclei are also positive for p63. The tumor cells are negative for cytokeratin 5/6. The morphologic findings demonstrate a poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma with the immunohistochemical staining pattern demonstrating mixed glandular and squamous differentiation. The specimen will be submitted for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and PD-L1 testing with separate reports to follow. The case has been reviewed by Dr.  who concurs with the diagnosis. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis detected no evidence of an ALK (2p23) gene rearrangement. However, 1-5 additional copies of ALK were observed in 84% of the cells. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.    FISH analysis revealed no break-apart signal pattern specific for ROS1 (6q22.1) gene rearrangement. However, a deletion of ROS1 was detected in 27% of cells analyzed. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.    Monitoring for these abnormalities may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.    It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with other clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.    FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the ALK (2p23; FDA-approved) and the ROS1 (6q22.1) dual color, break apart rearrangement probes (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL).

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.
