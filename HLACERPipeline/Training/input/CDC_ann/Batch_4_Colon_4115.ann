COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing.

The presence of an activating V600E <i>BRAF</i> mutation indicates a poor prognosis in certain subtypes of colorectal cancer. The presence of the V600E <i>BRAF</i> mutation has also been associated with insensitivity to anti-<i>EGFR</i> agents. In the setting of microsatellite instability, a <i>BRAF</i> mutation makes the possibility of Lynch Syndrome unlikely and is consistent with a sporadic tumor.<BR/><BR/>The S602A mutation has not been reported in any of the publically available mutation databases, therefore the clinical significance of this variant is unknown. This mutation is also located in the kinase domain of the BRAF protein, and other mutations in codon 602 are reported to be activating. This mutation is located on the same allele as the above V600E mutation (eg. in <i>cis</i>).<BR/><BR/> This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: exons 10 and 14, consisting of codons 464 to 472 and 581 to 601 (specifically including codon V600). Unless specifically indicated, no mutations were detected in these regions.

The results of the case was called to the office of Dr. (RN Jarboe) on 8/24/2017 at 11:19 am CT. Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: exons 2, 3 and 4 consisting of codons 10-35, 55-76, 109-131 and 138-150 (specifically including codons G12, G13, Q61, K117, A146). <BR/><BR/>Colombino, , et al. <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i> 30.20 (2012): 2522-2529. 2.
