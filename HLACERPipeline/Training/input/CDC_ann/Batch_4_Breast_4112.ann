The specimen is labeled \"left breast, nodular mass inner, middle 3rd, 4 cm from nipple\" on the requisition, \"L breast\" on the container. Received in formalin, in a device with chambers numbered 1-6, are multiple needle biopsy cores of fatty and fibrofatty tissue, up to 1.7 cm in length. The specimen is totally submitted in cassette 1A.\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - Other abnormal and inconclusive findings on diagnostic imaging of breast (R92.8), nodular mass- inner middle third, 4 cm from left nipple\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\nLeft breast nodular mass, inner middle third, 4 cm from nipple, core biopsy:   Papillary carcinoma, nuclear grade 2 to 3, classification pending. See comment.\n\n\nPath report.microscopic examination\n\nThe cores demonstrate multiple fairly well-circumscribed duct-like spaces containing papillary carcinoma, with grade 2 to 3 nuclei, and associated microcalcifications, but without necrosis. The intervening stroma is fibrotic with focal evidence of organizing hemorrhage. Diagnostic foci of destructive stromal invasion or angiolymphatic invasion are not appreciated morphologically, though focal crush artifact and/or tissue dispacement are seen. Immunostains are applied with satisfactory positive and negative controls. ER is diffusely positive (see diagnostic comment for details). p63 shows an absence of myoepithelial cells both within and around the lesions. SMMHC is also largely negative in the same distribution, though there are focal suggestions of peripheral myoepithelial staining. The differential diagnosis for papillary lesions is broad, indicating complete excision for proper classification.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nLeft breast cores\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - Papillary lesions are difficult to classify on core biopsy. Complete excision is recommended for thorough evaluation and definitive classification. See microscopic description for additional discussion. Immunohistochemical stain for estrogen receptor has been performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. Positive and negative controls react appropriately. The results are as follows:  Estrogen Receptor (SP1): 2-3+ nuclear staining, approx100% of nuclei Additional prognostic markers withheld until evaluation of complete excision. The case was discussed with Dr. on 8/7/17.\n\n\n"
