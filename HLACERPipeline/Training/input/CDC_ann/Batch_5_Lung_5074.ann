The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as \"RUL wedge\" consists of a right upper lobe lung resection specimen measuring 9.0 x 3.5 x 2.1 cm received with the resection margin stapled in 10% buffered formalin. The specimen is cut through the mass prior to receipt in pathology. There are two small tan-yellow flat pleural plaques measuring 0.2-0.4 cm in greatest dimension. The remaining visceral pleura is smooth and unremarkable. Parietal pleura or pericardium is not identified. There is a 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm tan nodular mass within the lung parenchyma, 1.4 cm from the stapled resection margin and 0.5 cm away from this mass is a microcoil. The remaining lung parenchyma is unremarkable.\nRepresentative sections as follows:\n1A staple resection margin closest to mass, en face (before staples are removed)\n1B pleural plaques\n1C-1D mass in toto, trisected\n1E microcoil site\n1F lung parenchyma \n\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nLung Ca\n\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\n\n1. Lung (right upper lobe), wedge resection:\na. Invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated acinar predominant type with:\n  - Maximum tumor dimension: 0.8 cm\n  - Negative for visceral pleural invasion\n  - Parenchymal resection margin negative for malignancy (closest: 1.4 cm)\n\n \n\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\n\n- POSITIVE for EGFR exon 19 deletion (see Molecular Diagnostics report)\n\n- NEGATIVE for ALK by immunohistochemistry (see Addendum Comment)\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock 1C was selected for mutation profiling. An area measuring 2 mm and containing estimated 50% tumor cellularity is marked for coring and DNA isolation.\n\nALK immunohistochemistry is performed at HOSPITAL using the 5A4 antibody with a protocol optimized for detection of ALK gene rearrangement in lung cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nLung: Right Wedge resection wedge RUL\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nSections of the wedge resection show an invasive adenocarcinoma demonstrating acinar (60%) and lepidic (40%) architecture with a minimal (less than 5%) component of micropapillary pattern. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells stain positive for TTF-1 and CK7, in keeping with pulmonary origin.\n\nMolecular Number:         M16.5365\nTest Method(s) Used:        EGFR-RT52\nEGFR Result:            Positive\nMutation Detected:         Exon 19 Deletion\n\nDNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded lung: right wedge RUL, block C, and analyzed using the EGFR-RT52 kit from EntroGen. This kit is based on a real-time PCR qualitative genotyping assay that uses fluorescently labeled probes for detection of 30 recurrent mutations in exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the EGFR gene, including exon 20 resistance mutations (T790M, S768I, and insertions). Details of the mutations tested are available upon request. \n\nThe lower limit of mutation detection using this assay is 2.5-5%. Minimum tumor cellularity for analysis is 5%. \n\nThis analysis is based on current knowledge of the most common EGFR mutations and their presence in adenocarcinoma of the lung. Somatic mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain are present in 10-40% of non-small cell lung cancers. The presence of these mutations will predict clinical response or resistance to EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva). Rarely, T790M occurs in untreated patients and may be present as an underlying germline mutation; this test will not discriminate germline T790M mutations from testing of tumor alone. This test will not identify rare mutations, such as E709K and D770_N771ins and is not appropriate for squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. Only adenocarcinomas of the lung or lung cancers with an adenocarcinoma component should be sent for testing. \n\nThe performance characteristics of this test were determined and verified by the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at the HOSPITAL. It has not been cleared or approved by the US FDA. FDA does not require this test to go through premarket FDA review. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.\n\nPan Q, et al.
