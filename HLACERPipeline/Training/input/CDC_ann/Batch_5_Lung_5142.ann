No variant was identified in the EGFR coding regions\nevaluated.\n\n2) BRAF: Positive. A variant was identified in the BRAF coding regions\nevaluated and is designated as follows:\nVariant designation per Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS):\nGenomic DNA level:  Chr7(GRCh37):g.140453145A>T\nCoding DNA level:  NM_004333.4(BRAF):c.1790T>A\nProtein level:    p.Leu597Gln\nCommonly used designation: L597Q\nThe clinical significance of this variant in lung carcinoma is not well\nestablished, although it has been previously reported. It is thought to be an\nactivating variant with increased kinase activity. Most variants that result in\nincreased kinase activity have been associated with decreased sensitivity to\ngefitinib (Gandhi et al. 2009;4:e4576) and some have been shown to have\nincreased sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib. Preclinical and\nclinical studies suggest that downstream inhibition of MEK may be an alternative\ntreatment in neoplasms with activating BRAF variants.\nInformation relating to inhibitor therapy for tumors carrying this specific\nvariant could not be found at this time.\n\nComments:\nThis is a qualitative assay with a sensitivity of approximately 5%. This means\nthat approximately 5% of the total DNA in the sample must contain an EGFR\nvariant to be detected as positive.\nFor concerns or questions regarding this testing, please contact the signing\npathologist at 705-675-4779.\n\nMethod Summary:\nTotal genomic DNA was extracted from the sample and the regions defined in the\ntable below amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (AmpliSeq ultraplex\nPCR design, Life Technologies). Universal sequencing primers, including a\npatient-specific index tag sequence (Ion Torrent, Life Technologies), were\nattached to both ends of the amplified fragments and sequencing performed using\nan Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM, Life Technologies). Variant\nevaluation was performed using a combination of an automated variant analysis\nprogram (variantCaller, Life Technologies) and manual inspection.\nAnalysis reference sequence: GRCh37 (hg19)\nGene\nTranscript\nExon\nGenome DNA Region\nCoding Region\nProtein Codons\n\n\n\n\nEGFR\nNM_005228.3\n 18\ng.55,241,614 - 55,241,736\nc.2062 - 2184\np.688 - 728\n\n 19\ng.55,242,415 - 55,242,513\nc.2185 - 2283\np.729 - 761\n\n 20\ng.55,248,986 - 55,249,171\nc.2284 - 2469\np.762 - 823\n\n 21\ng.55,259,412 - 55,259,567\nc.2470 - 2625\np.824 - 875\nBRAF\nNM_004333.4\n11\ng.140,481,391 - 140,481,493\nc.1315 - 1417\np.439 - 473\n\n15\ng.140,453,075 - 140,453,193\nc.1742 - 1860\np.581 - 620\n\nReferences:\n1.
