Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) Report ALK Analysis RESULT:   No Evidence of ALK Gene Rearrangement Detected by FISH Special studies report received from Integrated Oncology, 5005 S. 40th Street, Suite 1100, Phoenix, AZ, 85040, on case, labeled with their number , dated 06/09/2017. EGFR Gene Mutation Analysis INTERPRETATION:   Negative for EGFR Mutation. Indication for Study:   Adenocarcinoma Specimen Site and Type:   Paraffin-Embedded Tissue-Lung, LUL Nucleotide Change: Amino Acid Change: Comments: No mutations were detected within the analyzed region of the EGFR gene in the sample provided for analysis. Less than 5% of non-small cell lung carcinoma patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory findings for the most accurate interpretation. A subgroup of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has shown clinical responsiveness to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors gefitinib (IRESSA) and erlotinib (Tarceva), including never smokers, individuals of Asian ethnicity, and those with adenocarcinoma histology. In the majority of patients with highly responsive tumors, the tumor contains a somatic mutation within the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. The presence of a somatic EGFR mutation is significantly associated with response to gefitinib and erlotinib, and is strongly predictive of prolonged survival in NSCLC patients. See report for further information. Electronically Signed by on 6/9/2017 at Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc. DABMG, DABCC, DLMcm, M(ASCP)cm, MB(ASCP)cm Methodology: Genomic DNA was isolated from the provided tumor specimen. Exons 18 through 21 of the EGFR gene were subjected to SNaPShot multiplex PCR and primer extension for mutation detection. This assay is able to detect 2-20% mutation in a background of wild-type DNA.
