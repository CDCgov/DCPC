However, 1-4 additional copies of ALK were observed in 86% of the cells. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.   FISH analysis revealed no break-apart signal pattern specific for ROS1 (6q22.1) gene rearrangement. However, 1-3 additional copies of ROS1 were observed in 22% of the cells. According to a study by Jin, Y et al. (see references below) ROS1 gene copy number gain (CNG) was found in 4.8 % of cases. ROS1 gene CNG was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS, 12 vs. 58 months; p=0.003) and shorter overall survival (OS, 40 vs. 67 months; p <0.001) than the group without CNG. Additional copies of ROS1 gene is an independent poor prognostic factor.   It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with other clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.   Of note, a previous FISH study from 7/12/2017 (see 17-21-007021) was positive for additional copies of ALK, and a deletion of ROS1. Continuing monitoring for these anomalies may be useful in assessing the patient's remission/relapse status.   FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the ALK (2p23; FDA-approved) and the ROS1 (6q22.1) dual color, break apart rearrangement probes (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL).
