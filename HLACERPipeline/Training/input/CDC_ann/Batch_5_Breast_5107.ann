The degree of atypia and\n   volume of lesional tissue present is consistent with carcinoma. Although the\n   WOHS immunostains for P63 and smooth muscle myosin do not clearly show a\n   myoepithelial cell layer associated with and encircling the atypical ductal\n   epithelial proliferation with papillary features, given its papillary\n   morphology, in my opinion, the differential diagnosis includes encapsulated\n   papillary carcinoma, and although the possibility of invasive ductal carcinoma\n   cannot be excluded based on this limited needle core biopsy sampling, it also\n   cannot be made here with certainty. Histologic examination of the lesion in its\n   intact tissue context will be required for the definitive diagnosis of invasive\n   ductal carcinoma. A few of the smaller ductal structures with the atypical\n   ductal epithelial proliferation appear to exhibit an intact myoepithelial cell\n   layer on WOHS immunostaining for P63 and smooth muscle myosin, and are\n   consistent with a ductal carcinoma in situ component.\n   The existence of a subsequent left mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy\n   specimen ( S15-20590) from Dec. 11, 2015 is noted, and this case is\n   currently under review at HOSPITAL (HOSPITAL S16-23638). Definitive diagnosis and\n   classification of the carcinoma present in the left breast needle core biopsy\n   specimen WOHS S15-28380 is deferred to this left mastectomy specimen.\nBruce J.
