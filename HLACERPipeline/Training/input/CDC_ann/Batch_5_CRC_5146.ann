There are micronodules at the distal portion of the specimen.  \nIleocecal valve: Diameter 3.0 cm. The ileocecal valve is covered by ulceration and exudate \nand is hemorrhagic. The perforation (1.5 cm) is directly adjacent to the ileocecal valve.  \nCecum: 9.0 x 7.0 cm, wall thickness 0.3 cm. \nSerosa: There is overlying exudate and adhesions. There is reaction around the perforation.  \nMucosa: The mucosa is markedly edematous. The area of ulceration extends into cecum and has \noverall dimensions of 8.5 x 2.5 cm. The ulcer is situated 8.0 cm from the proximal margin \nand 2.5 cm from the distal margin. There is attached mesentery and retroperitoneal fat; the \nulcer is situated 2.0 cm from the closest non-mucosal margin.  \nAppendix: 5.5 cm length x 0.7-1.0 cm diameter. The appendix is adhered to the mesentery in a \nU-shape. It is more dilated proximally.  \n \nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows: \n(1) through (2) - proximal resection margin, terminal ileum, en face \n(3) through (6) - distal margin, cecum, en face \n(7) - mesenteric margin \n(8) through (9) - terminal ileum, including exudate on serosa \n(10) - micronodular mucosa distal terminal ileum  \n(11) - ileocecal valve, adjacent to site of perforation  \n(12) through (13) - longitudinal section of obliterated ileocecal valve including ulceration \nand hemorrhage \n(14) - ileocecal valve ulceration and fibrotic wall \n(15) through (16) - perforation site, cecum \n(17) and (18) - markedly edematous cecum \n(19) - ulceration across ileocecal valve  \n(20) through (21) - hemorrhagic edge of ulceration, cecum \n(22) through (23) - cross sections of appendix  \n(24) - tip of appendix \n(25) - two lymph nodes  \n\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nBowel obstruction  \n\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\nRIGHT HEMICOLECTOMY WITH APPENDIX: FEATURES SUGGESTIVE OF DIFFUSE LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA AT \nILEOCECAL VALVE, WITH; \n- TUMOR INVOLVING FULL THICKNESS OF BOWEL WALL AND PERI-COLIC SOFT TISSUE  \n  WITH PERFORATION \n- NO ADJACENT MUCOSAL ABNORMALITIES \n- LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION \n- 4 BENIGN REGIONAL LYMPH NODES (0/4) \n \nCOMMENT: MORPHOLOGY IS SUGGESTIVE OF A DIFFUSE LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA.
