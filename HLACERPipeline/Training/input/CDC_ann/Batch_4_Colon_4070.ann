Medicare contractors require utilizing Amsterdam or revised Bethesda criteria and IHC as a first step in screening for Lynch Syndrome in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC). NCCN guidelines recommends all patients with newly diagnosed CRC to be offered Lynch Syndrome testing, including MSI and/or MMR-IHC. MSI and/or MMR-IHC are also useful in providing prognostic and therapeutic response information, such as 5-FU therapy, in CRC. A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated MSI to be associated with response to certain immune checkpoint inhibitors. NCCN guidelines also recommend genomic profiling in certain colorectal tumors for prognostic and/or therapeutic decision making. Mutations in certain genes such as KRAS and NRAS predict for lack of response to monoclonal anti-EGFR targeted therapies. Two recent studies have associated aspirin use to be associated with improved survival in patients with colorectal tumors harboring mutations in the PIK3CA gene. BRAF mutations are associated with an aggressive clinical course and many promising clinical trials are enrolling patients based on the mutational status of this gene. Genomic aberrations in other genes including TP53, KRAS, CMET, PTEN, CTNNB1, and APC have also been associated with an aggressive clinical course. References will be furnished upon request. The revised Bethesda criteria include colon cancer diagnosed under the age of 50, presence of synchronous or metachronous CRC or other Lynch Syndrome associated tumor regardless of age, morphologic findings consistent with MSI-H histology in an individual who is less than 60, colon cancer diagnosed with one or more first degree relatives with a Lynch Syndrome related tumor, with one of the cancers diagnosed under the age of 50, or colon cancer in 2 or more first degree relatives with a lynch related tumor, regardless of age. Morphologic findings associated with MSI-H status include tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, signet ring cell features, mucinous histology, medullary growth pattern, neutrophilic infiltrate, poor differentiation, and/or syncytial growth pattern. It is important to note that revised Bethesda criteria can miss a significant percentage of patients who have an inherited predisposition to CRC. Genomic profiling for prognostic and therapeutic information is underway. If there is clinical or morphologic suspicion of Lynch Syndrome, please contact PathGroup customer service at 855-854-6473 to request additional Lynch Syndrome testing. ## End of auxiliary report ## Addendum Report: Results of mismatch repair protein immunohistochemistry:    - DNA mismatch repair enzymes intact (normal protein expression).    - See comment.  COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing. [References available on request]. ## End of auxiliary report ## Ancillary Report: Immunoperoxidase staining was performed and evaluated with appropriate controls. Tumor cells are positive for CDX2. CDX2 expression has important prognostic value in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Loss of CDX2 expression is associated with an aggressive clinical course including infiltrative growth, and advanced T, N, M and overall stage.

Ancillary studies, including molecular testing, will be reported separately. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis detected a MET (7q31.2) gene amplification. While the MET/CEP7 ratio was 1.18, 32% of cells had 6 or more copies of MET and the average copy number of MET was 6.91. Amplification of MET is associated with poor prognosis in a variety of neoplasms. Amplification of MET also plays a role in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors of patients with EGFR-mutant tumors. Limited studies suggest that MET-amplified tumors may respond to crizotinib, an inhibitor of MET and ALK.   FISH revealed no evidence of HER2 (17q12) gene amplification. The HER2/CEP17 ratio was 1.29. However, 1-5 additional copies of HER2 and CEP17 (centromere 17) were detected in 66% of cells analyzed, indicating polysomy of chromosome 17. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.    Monitoring for these anomalies may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.   It should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with classic cytogenetics, clinical, flow cytometric, and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed in interphase cells using the MET (7q31.2)/CEP7 (centromere 7) and CEP17 (centromere 17)/HER2 (17q12) dual color DNA amplification probes (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL).
