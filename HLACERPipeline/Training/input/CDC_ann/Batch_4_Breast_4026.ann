The specimen is inked with safranin and submitted entirely in cassette 1A, M/1. Also in the specimen container is a 3.0 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm aggregate of yellow tissue fragments. The specimen is filtered and entirely submitted in cassette 1B, M/1.\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nHistory - Right breast mass\n\n\nPath report.final diagnosis\n\nBreast, right at 6-o'clock, 2 cm from the nipple, Mammotome biopsy:   Invasive mammary carcinoma, no special type (ductal), high combined     histologic grade, high proliferative rate, measuring at least 5 mm in greatest     extent.   Calcifications associated with invasive carcinoma.   No definite in situ component identified.\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nHormone Receptor report: Invasive tumor cell nuclei (from block 1B) are negative for both estrogen and progesterone receptor. Controlled immunohistochemical stain for HER-2 is performed and shows the invasive tumor cells are negative. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis for possible HER-2 amplification is pending and will be reported separately. ## End of auxiliary report ## Fish Report: FISH - NEGATIVE for HER2 oncogene amplification by FISH analysis  NEGATIVE for chromosome 17 polysomy by FISH analysis       ## End of auxiliary report ##\n\n\nPath report.microscopic examination\n\nMicroscopic examination is performed.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\n6-o'clock, 2 cmfn, right breast macrolobulated hypoechoic mass with int vascularity measuring 1.1 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - Preliminary findings were communicated to Dr. 's nurse at 3:00 p.m. on 9/7/2017. Ancillary hormone receptor studies are pending and will be reported separately as an addendum. FISH Comments - The HER2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) did not reveal amplification of the HER2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 1.02 and a Her2 copy number of 2.08, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. There was no evidence of polysomy/polyploidy or genetic heterogeneity. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
