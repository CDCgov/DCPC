Anteriorly is a skin ellipse, 17.3 x 10.0 cm. In the lower portion of the mid skin ellipse is an areola approximately 3 cm in diameter surrounding a nipple 1.3 cm diameter. A flesh colored papule is present in the 12-o'clock area immediately above the areola approximately 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. In the upper lateral quadrant is a palpable firm nodule approximately 4 cm greatest dimension. The overlying skin is soft supple and without ulcerations. The posterior margin is inked in black, the superior margin is inked in blue, and the inferior margin is inked in green. The specimen is serially transverse sectioned revealing a firm irregular white mass measuring 4.0 x 3.5 x 2.7 cm. The mass closely approximates the posterior inked margin. Upon sectioning of the mass, the mass is white-pink and firm. No areas of necrosis are identified grossly. A second smaller firm irregular white mass is noted in the medial upper quadrant, 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.8 cm in greatest dimension. The mass is separated from the posterior margin by approximately 1 cm. A distance of approximately 6 cm separates the 2 masses. The axillary fragment is removed and evaluated for lymph nodes. Multiple lymph nodes are identified, the largest node approximately 2.4 cm in greatest dimension. 1A, nipples; 1B-1F, sections from main, larger mass; 1G-1I, sections from smaller mass; 1J, skin overlying larger mass and papule on skin; 1K-1L, 2 lymph nodes, both bisected; 1M-1P, lymph nodes; 1Q-1T, additional sections of mass.

The grade of the main mass is based on a score of 8 of 9 (glandular/acinar/tubular differentiation - 2; nuclear pleomorphism - 3; mitotic rate - 3). The grade of the smaller mass is based on a score of 4 of 9 (glandular/acinar/tubular differentiation - 1; nuclear pleomorphism - 2; mitotic rate - 1). FISH Comments - The HER2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) did not reveal amplification of the HER2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 1.04 and a Her2 copy number of 2.08, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. There was no evidence of polysomy/polyploidy or genetic heterogeneity. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
