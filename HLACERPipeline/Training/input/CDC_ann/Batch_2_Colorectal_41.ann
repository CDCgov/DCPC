KRAS Gene Mutation Analysis INTERPRETATION: The specimen was negative for the tested seven KRAS gene mutations. Indication for Study:   Adenocarcinoma Specimen Type:     Paraffin-Embedded Tissue-Colon Comments: The KRAS test is designed to detect seven mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene (see methodology). These seven mutations account for >97% of all reported KRAS mutations in CRC patients. Samples with results reported as \"no mutations detected\" may harbor KRAS mutations that are not detected by the assay. Detection of mutation is depended on sample integrity and the amount of amplifiable DNA present in the specimen. The methods used in this assay are highly selective and, depending on the total amount of DNA present, can detect approximately 1-5% of mutant in background of wild-type genomic DNA. See report MNR17-000633 for further information. Analytical Results: Assay Type     Detection Parameters   Result Gene Mutation Analysis   Codons 12 and 13   Negative - Not Detected Electronically Signed by on 6/9/2017 at Accupath Diagnostic Laboratories, Inc.Methodology: DNA is isolated from FFPE specimen. DNA analysis of the mutations in the KRAS gene is performed using ARMS and Scorpions technology. This FDA approved KRAS assay is a real-time qualitative PCR assay used on the Rotor-Gene Q MDx instrument for the detection of seven most common somatic mutations in the human KRAS oncogene, using DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue. This assay is intended to aid in the identification of CRC patients for treatment with Erbitux (cetuximab) based on a KRAS no mutation detected test result. The presence of these mutations correlates with a lack of response for certain EGFR inhibitor cancer therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Mutations: Gly12Asp (35G>A), Gly12Ala (35G>C), Gly12Val (35G>T), Gly12Ser (34G>A), Gly12Arg (34G>C), Gly12Cys (34G>T), Gly13Asp (38G>A). References: 1. Janne PA, Engelman JA, Johnson BE.

NRAS Mutation Detection by PCR-SNAPSHOT Analysis   INTERPRETATION:    Negative - No evidence of NRAS mutations was detected in codons 12, 13, 59, 60, 61, 117 and 146 of exons 2, 3 and 4 Indication for Study:   Adenocarcinoma Specimen Type:     Paraffin-Embedded Tissue-Colon Comments: Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory findings for the most accurate interpretation. Samples with results reported as \"no mutation detected\" may harbor NRAS mutations that are not detected by the assay. NRAS is a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein involved in downstream receptor signaling which is critical for cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Mutations in the NRAS oncogene are frequently found in human cancers. They are seen in melanoma (\\R\\18%), colorectal cancer (\\R\\2%), hematopoietic and lymphoid cancer (\\R\\10%), and thyroid cancer (8%). This assay will detect NRAS mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 (see mutation list below). Recent NCCN guidelines have recommended that anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab for the first-line treatment be given only to patients who are negative for both KRAS and NRAS mutations. NRAS mutations are found in approximately 1-6% of colorectal cancer. See Molecular report MKF17-000325 for further information.

Perry Chan, Ph.D., MBA DABMG, DABCC, DLMcm, M(ASCP)cm, MB(ASCP)cm Methodology: Genomic DNA was isolated from the provided tumor specimen. Exons 2, 3 and 4 of the NRAS gene were subjected to SNaPshot multiplex PCR and primer extension for mutation detection. This assay is able to detect 5% mutation in a background of wild-type DNA. Intended Use: The detection of a NRAS mutation aids in identification of patients with worse prognosis and who may not respond to certain cancer therapies. References: 1.
