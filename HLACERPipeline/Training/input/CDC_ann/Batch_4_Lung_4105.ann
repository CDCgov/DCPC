If clinically appropriate, consideration may be given to broader genomic profiling. <BR/><BR/> This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: portions of exons 18-21, consisting of codons 699-726, 729-840, 848-869 (specifically including codons E709, G719, S768, T790, L833, L858, L861 and deletions and insertions in exons 19 and 20).

This is an uncommon mutation with limited information regarding clinical significance in lung cancer. Biochemical characterization of the mutation indicates it activates the protein kinase function of the BRAF protein, and increases the downstream signalling of the MEK and ERK pathways.<BR/><BR/> This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: exons 10 and 14, consisting of codons 464 to 472 and 581 to 601 (specifically including codon V600).

Napsin and TTF1 immunostains show an immunoreacitivy pattern characteristic of primary lung origin. Because the clinical record mentions the absence of a smoking history and the consideration of metastasis, and because of the presence of occasional clear cells, a PAX8 immunostain was also performed to evaluate for a renal neoplasm and this is negative. All controls react appropriately.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nRight upper lobe\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - Ancillary testing (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, and PDL-1) will be performed and reported separately. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed no break-apart signal pattern specific for ROS1 (6q22.1) gene rearrangement. However, a deletion of ROS1 was detected in 62% of cells analyzed. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown.   Monitoring for this anomaly may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.   FISH analysis revealed no ALK (2p23) gene rearrangement. However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with other clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  ALK Breakapart (5`ALK; 3`ALK) - FDA Approved (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  ROS1 Breakapart (5`ROS1; 3`ROS1) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)   References:  J Mol Diagn. 2013 Apr 4. doi:pii: S1525-1578(13)00041-X.

Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur.
