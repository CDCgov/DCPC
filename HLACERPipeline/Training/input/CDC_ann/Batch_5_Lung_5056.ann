LYMPH NODE, BIOPSY (STATION 5, SUBAORTIC):\n   - LYMPH NODE TISSUE; NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY\nB. LYMPH NODE, BIOPSY (STATION 11, INTERLOBAR):\n   - LYMPH NODE TISSUE; NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANCY\nC.

The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and as\n   station 5, subaortic. The specimen consists of three brown-black lymph nodes\n   ranging in size from 1.2 cm to 1.6 cm in greatest dimension. The lymph nodes\n   are submitted in toto as follows:\n   A1 - A3  - one bisected lymph node each.\nB.  The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and as\n   station 11, interlobar. The specimen consists of a piece of brown-black soft\n   tissue measuring 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. The specimen is submitted in toto in\n   cassette B.\nC.  The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and as\n   left upper lobe, consists of a left upper lobectomy specimen weighing 170 grams\n   before inflation and measuring 3.5 cm ML and the other axis cannot be defined\n   and measures 19.0 cm x 12.5 cm. The bronchial resection margin measures 2.5 cm\n   in circumference and 0.5 cm in length. The stapled parenchymal resection margin\n   measures 10.0 cm in length. The pleural surface is smooth, glistening and shows\n   multiple bullae. On sectioning, a whitish firm irregular tumor with\n   anthracotic areas is identified which measures 2.2 cm x 1.8 cm x 1.7 cm.\n   Towards one periphery the tumor is bilobed and apears to be two different\n   adjacent nodules and the smaller nodule measures 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.\n   The tumor is seen 2.5 cm from the stapled bronchial resection margin, and 2.3\n   cm from the stapled parenchymal resection margin. The surrounding lung\n   parenchyma shows increasing emphysematous changes and the tumor is seen 0.7 cm\n   from the closest pleural surface. No postpneumonic changes are identified in\n   the surrounding lung parenchyma. No further nodules are identified. Four\n   potential lymph nodes are identified in the hilum ranging in size from 0.4 cm\n   to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as\n   follows:\n   C1    - bronchial and the rest of the resection margin en face.\n   C2    - stapled parenchyma resection margin en face.\n   C3    - full thickness section of the tumor with closest pleural surface.\n   C4 - C5  - full thickness section of the tumor with surrounding lung\n         parenchyma with emphysematous changes.\n   C6    - tumor at periphery showing bilobed nature.\n   Please note that the tumor is submitted in toto with surrounding lung\n   parenchyma.\n   C7    - uninvolved lung parenchyma.\n   C8    - one lymph node.\n   C9    - two lymph nodes.\n   C10    - one bisected lymph node.\n\n\nADDENDUMS\n\nSURGICAL PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION REPORT\nNote:\nThis report was originally sent to Dr. Reingold and was not received in the\nDepartment of Pathology.

However, there is a possibility\nthat it may not detect all forms of ALK gene rearrangement.\nMolecular Diagnostics\nSuzanne Kamel-Reid, PhD., FACMG\nInterpretation\n   Molecular Number:       M13.9564\n   EGFR RFLP Exon 19 Result:   Undetectable\n   EGFR RFLP Exon 21 Result:   Undetectable\n   RFLP Overall Result:     Undetectable\nDNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded lung, LUL, S08-25195-C06, and analyzed\nusing fragment analysis. The EGFR exon 19 deletion assay was based on assessing\nsize differences of fluorescently labelled PCR products. The presence/absence of an\nexon 21 L858R point mutation was assessed by performing PCR followed by Sau96I\nrestriction enzyme digestion.\nThere was no evidence for the presence of a deletion in exon 19 or a L858R\nsubstitution in exon 21 of the EGFR gene.\nThe lower limit of mutation detection using this assay is 1-5%.\nThis analysis is based on current knowledge of the most common EGFR mutations and\ntheir presence in non-small cell lung cancer. Deletions in exon 19 and the L858R\nsubstitution observed in exon 21 account for 85-90% of EGFR mutations in non-small\ncell lung cancers that respond to EGFR inhibitors. Analytical validity and\nsensitivity of this test was determined and verified by the Molecular Diagnostics\nLaboratory at the HOSPITAL. It has not been cleared or approved by\nthe US FDA.\nPan Q, et al. JMD 2005; 7(3):396-403\nTsao MS, et al. NEJM 2005; 353(2): 133-144\nRiely GJ, et al.
