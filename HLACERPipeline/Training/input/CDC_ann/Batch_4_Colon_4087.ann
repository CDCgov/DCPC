Received labeled \", sigmoid colon.\" Received in formalin is an intact segment of bowel with attached mesenteric fat measuring 18.5 cm in length x 2.5 cm in average diameter. The serosal surface is smooth and glistening with a circumferential retracted area located 6.5 cm from the nearest surgical margin of resection. Opening the bowel reveals a 95% circumferential fungating mass at retracted area measuring 4.0 x 3.0 x 1.6 cm extending to within 4.8 cm of the nearest surgical margin of resection and to within 3.5 cm of the radial margin. The mass appears to extend through the bowel wall and into the fat. No additional masses or nodules are seen. Two non-perforating diverticula are present, 3.0 cm from the mass. Sectioning attached mesenteric fat reveals 20 pink-tan rubbery firm nodules consistent with lymph nodes ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. An area of gray-white nodules are present matted together within the fat which has the same appearance as previously described mass upon cut surfaces. The serosal surface overlying mass is inked black. Summary of sections: 1A, sections opposing surgical margin of resection; 1B, radial mesenteric margin; 1C-D, representative sections of mass with overlying inked serosal surface; 1E-F, representative sections of mass with adjacent fat; 1G, section involving both diverticula; 1H, 11 lymph nodes; 1I, 9 lymph nodes; 1J, sections side by side gray-white nodules within fat. 2.

Additional nodules are well circumscribed and have an appearance consistent with expanded vascular structures with necrotic tumor. The tumor present in the section of mesenteric margin appears to be in lymphovascular spaces (not direct extension). A section of the tumor with surrounding normal tissue will be sent for MSI/Lynch Syndrome testing. This will be reported separately. This case was seen in consultation with Dr. K. , who concurs with the diagnosis.\n\n\n"
