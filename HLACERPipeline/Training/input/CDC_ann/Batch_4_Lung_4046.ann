COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing.

However, 1-4 additional copies of ALK were observed in 78% of the cells, consistent with gain of the 2p23 chromosome region. Low-level gain of ALK is a genetic abnormality of unknown clinical significance.    FISH analysis revealed no break-apart signal pattern specific for ROS1 (6q22.1) gene rearrangement. However, 1-3 additional copies of ROS1 were observed in 40% of the cells. According to a study by Jin, Y et al. (see references below) ROS1 gene copy number gain (CNG) was found in 4.8 % of cases. ROS1 gene CNG was significantly associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS, 12 vs. 58 months; p=0.003) and shorter overall survival (OS, 40 vs. 67 months; p <0.001) than the group without CNG. Additional copies of ROS1 gene is an independent poor prognostic factor.    FISH revealed no evidence of MET gene amplification. The MET/CEP7 ratio was 1.03. However, 1-3 additional copies of MET and CEP7 were detected in 71% of cells analyzed, suggesting the presence of polysomy of chromosome 7.    FISH revealed no evidence of deletion of PTEN (10q23). However, additional copies of PTEN and CEP10 were detected in 64% of cells analyzed, suggesting the presence of polysomy of chromosome 10.    FISH analysis revealed no evidence of a RET (10q11.21) gene rearrangement. However, 1-3 additional copies of RET were detected in 63% of cells analyzed.    FISH revealed no evidence of deletion of TP53 (17p13.1) or NF1 (17q11.2). However, additional copies of NF1 were detected in 38% of cells analyzed. Additionally, FISH revealed no evidence of HER2 gene amplification. The HER2/CEP17 ratio was 0.92. However, 1-2 additional copies of HER2 and CEP17 were detected in 57% of cells analyzed, suggesting the presence of polysomy of chromosome 17.    Overall, these results are indicative of a complex abnormal karyotype (3 or more abnormalities) likely predicting for a rapid disease progression and a poor treatment outcome. Monitoring for these anomalies may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.    No evidence of PIK3CA gene amplification. However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.    FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  CEP7/MET (Centromere 7/7q31) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  CEP17/HER2 (Centromere 17/17q12) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  CEP10/PTEN (Centromere 10/10q23) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  ALK Breakapart (5`ALK; 3`ALK) - FDA Approved (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  ROS1 Breakapart (5`ROS1; 3`ROS1) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  RET Breakapart (5`RET; 3`RET) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  RPN1/PIK3CA (3q21/3q26) (MetaSystems Group Inc., Newton, MA)  TP53/NF1 (17p13.1/17q11.2) (MetaSystems Group Inc., Newton, MA)    References:  Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol. 2010, 2(1): a001008; Oncotarget. 2014, 5(15): 5873 5892; J Clin Pathol. 2015, 68(4):253-7; World J Biol Chem. 2015, 6(2):16-27; Mol Biol Int. 2014, 2014:852748; Int J Oncol. 2012, 40(3):639-44; Clin Cancer Res. 2010, 16(17):4325-30. Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and total RNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated RNA was subjected to reverse transcription, and double stranded DNA was constructed. The specimen was universal-tagged and barcoded, and subjected to hemi-nested multiplex PCR using gene-specific primers and universal tag specific primers (Archer FusionPlex chemistry). The products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using Archer Analysis Software, v4.1. The analytic sensitivity is approximately 5 RNA molecules encoding the fusion, and is dependent on the specific fusion event present. All fusions are relative to the reported reference transcript. This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.
