Received in formalin labeled \"\" and \"sigmoid colon\" is a 9.0 cm in length segment of colon having an average diameter of 3.0 cm and contains bilateral stapled margins. Also submitted separately are 2 tan-brown mucosal rings of tissue. Upon opening, there is a 4.2 x 2.3 cm pink-tan, slightly friable mass. The mass is approximately 2.0 cm from each opposing margin. Upon sectioning, the mass ranges in thickness from 0.5 cm up to 1.1 cm with gross invasion into the underlying wall and invading into the underlying subserosal adipose tissue. The mass is approximately 4.0 cm from the mesenteric margin. The remainder of the segment displays pink-tan mucosal folds arranged in the usual manner. The wall averages 0.2 cm in thickness. The fat surrounding the segment of colon is stripped away. Serial sectioning of the fat reveals multiple lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.4 cm up to 1.0 cm in greatest dimension, some of which display firm, tan-white gross tumor involvement. The separate submitted tan-brown mucosal rings measure 1.8 x 1.6 x 1.0 cm and 2.7 x 1.7 x 1.1 cm. Sectioning of each reveals unremarkable cut surface and black suture material. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A and 1B, margins, 1/1 in each; 1C-1E, full-thickness trisected section of mass at deepest invasion and nearest resected margin, junction between 1C and 1D is inked orange, junction between 1D and 1E is inked green, resected margin is inked blue (1C contains mass portion, 1D mid portion, 1E resected margin portion), 1/1 in each; 1F and 1G, sections of mass with adjacent normal mucosa, 1/1 in each; 1H, additional section of mass with gross invasion, 1/1; 1I, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1J, 5 lymph nodes, 5/1; 1K, 5 lymph nodes displaying firm gross tumor involvement, 5/1; 1L, section with possible lymph node matting/tumor invasion into adjacent fatty tissue, 1/1; 1M, sections of vessels with adjacent fatty tissue, 3/1; 1N, separately submitted mucosal rings, 2/1. 2. Received in formalin labeled \"\" and \"left lobe liver biopsy\" are multiple tan-brown cores and core fragments ranging in size from 0.2 cm up to 0.7 cm and having an average diameter of 0.1 cm, in aggregate 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm.
