There is a palpable peripheral nodule noted near the apex\nof the lung with slight retraction of the overlying pleural surface with scarring.\nThere is an adjacent 2.5 cm fibrous plaque overlying the apex. The remainder of the\npleura is grossly unremarkable. There is a prominent 1.5 cm anthracotic lymph node\nnoted near the bronchial resection margin. The lymph node is bisected and submitted\nin total in Block A1. A second 1.5 cm anthracotic peribronchial lymph node is\nidentified which is bisected and submitted in total in Block A2. The bronchial\nresection margin shows intraluminal mucus but no evidence of malignancy. A cross\nsection of the bronchial resection margin is submitted in Block A3. The external\npleural surface of the lung is inked with silver nitrate and the lung is serially\nsectioned. The cut surface shows an ovoid tan neoplasm measuring 3.5 cm in greatest\ndimension. The tumour is solid with no cystic component, no obvious hemorrhage or\nnecrosis. The lesion, which has a somewhat ill-defined peripheral margin, comes to\nwithin at least 2 cm of the bronchial resection margin. Representative sections of\nthe tumour are submitted in Blocks A4 through A7. The remainder of the lung is\ngrossly unremarkable. A representative section of the scarred apex is submitted in\nBlock A8.\n\n\nADDENDUMS\n\nA.

I essentially\n        agree with the diagnosis originating pathologist.\n        The patient has also undergone wedge resection of right lower lobe at\n        Credit Valley HOSPITAL [16:S3145]. This resection shows moderately\n        differentiated adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous features.\n        Histologically, both the tumors show features of well to moderately\n        differentiated adenocarcinoma and appear histologically similar. The\n        papillary component is more prominent in the previously resected left\n        lung adenocarcinoma in 2004. However, possibility of these tumors\n        being independent primaries cannot be ruled out and should be\n        favored, in proper clinical context.\n\nDhamanaskar, Prashant, MD, FRCPC.
