Immunohistochemistry is additionally performed on block 3C for prognostic markers as above and in addition, smooth muscle myosin staining is positive around all foci of DCIS and lobular cancerization.

Controls: high protein expression,  Adequacy of sample for evaluation: Adequate Results:  Percentage of invasive tumor cells exhibiting  complete membrane staining: <5 Uniformity of staining: absent Homogeneous, dark circumferential staining: absent Interpretation:  Negative for HER2 protein overexpression, FISH being performed due to high tumor grade. This quantitative immunohistochemical evaluation of Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 (HER-2) is performed in accordance with all current guidelines as recommended by the ASCO and CAP.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\n1. Left breast sentinel node #1 2. Axillary tissue 3. Left breast tissue\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - Due to the high tumor grade we will perform FISH studies for HER-2 despite the 1+ IHC score. Should FISH be negative we will perform basal phenotype markers. FISH Comments - The HER2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) did not reveal amplification of the HER2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 1.07 and a Her2 copy number of 2.36, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. There was no evidence of polysomy/polyploidy or genetic heterogeneity. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin for 34hrs (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
