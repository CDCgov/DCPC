The specimen is received fresh labeled \", right sentinel node.\" It consists of a fragment of yellow to red soft tissue which measures 17 x 12 x 6 mm. Palpation and sectoring demonstrate a predominantly yellow to focal red-brown nodule consistent with a fatty replaced lymph node. Cytologic scrape preparations are made and examined for intraoperative consultation. The specimen is transferred to formalin for fixation prior to further evaluation. 2. Received in formalin labeled \", right needle localized biopsy, long lateral, short superior\" is a 35 g partial mastectomy specimen measuring 6.9 cm superior to inferior, 5.1 cm medial to lateral, and 2.0 cm anterior to posterior. A short stitch marks superior and a long stitch marks lateral. A needle localization wire is inserted into the inferoanterior aspect. The specimen is inked as follows: Anterior- green, posterior-black, superior-red, inferior-blue, medial-yellow, lateral-orange. Sectioning reveals a 1.1 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm firm, tan-white mass with a stellate border. The mass is associated with the needle localization wire, and contains a metal biopsy clip. The mass is less than 0.1 cm from the posterior margin, 0.7 cm from the anterior margin, 1.0 cm from the medial margin, 2.6 cm from the lateral margin, 1.1 cm from the superior margin, and 3.3 cm from the inferior margin. There is a firm, tan-white, possibly calcified nodule abutting the posterior margin, 1.0 cm from the medial margin, 3.0 cm from the lateral margin, 2.0 cm from the anterior margin, 1.5 cm from the inferior margin, and 3.5 cm from the superior margin. The possible calcified nodule is 1.7 cm from the mass. The cut surfaces are otherwise tan-yellow and soft, with minimal fibrous tissue.

Results will be reported separately. The case was amended on 8/18/2017 to change the checklist for focus #1 from pT1a to pT1c based on size. The top-line diagnoses and all other parts of the checklists are unchanged. FISH Comments - The HER2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) did not reveal amplification of the HER2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 1.08 and a Her2 copy number of 2.16, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. There was no evidence of polysomy/polyploidy or genetic heterogeneity. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
