These mutations appear to be in the same copy of the <i>EGFR</I> gene (eg. in <i>cis</i>). The specific mutations are listed below. The S768I mutation is an activating mutation, and is correlated with a lack of responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as erlotinib or gefitinib. The V769L mutation is uncommon, and has not been extensively analyzed. Limited data suggests that V769L is also resistant to erlotinib (Avizienyte, et al, <i>Biochme J</i>, 415:197-206; 2008). The clinical significance of both of these mutations in the same EGFR protein is unknown.<BR/><BR/> This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: portions of exons 18-21, consisting of codons 699-726, 729-840, 848-869 (specifically including codons E709, G719, S768, T790, L833, L858, L861 and deletions and insertions in exons 19 and 20). Unless specifically indicated, no mutations were detected in these regions.

Tumor varies from moderately to poorly differentiated morphologically. By immunoperoxidase, tumor cells are strongly positive for TTF-1 and cytokeratin 7 and show no positivity for cytokeratin 5/6 or p63. This immunohistochemical profile is indicative of a pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Basic lung molecular panel will be attempted on the small amount of tumor represented in this biopsy block. Further follow-up is suggested as clinically indicated. FISH Comments - Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed no break-apart signal patterns for ALK (2p23) or ROS1 (6q22.1) in the cells analyzed. However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with other clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.   FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:  ALK Breakapart (5`ALK; 3`ALK) - FDA Approved (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)  ROS1 Breakapart (5`ROS1; 3`ROS1) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)   References:  J Mol Diagn. 2013 Apr 4. doi:pii: S1525-1578(13)00041-X.

J Thorac Oncol. 2010 Mar;5(3):305-13  Molec Comments - The tissue specimen was reviewed by a pathologist, areas of tumor were microdissected from surrounding tissue, and genomic DNA isolated using standard methods. The isolated DNA was subjected to PCR using primers specific for the gene of interest. The PCR products were prepared and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq v2 chemistry. Sequence data was analyzed using standard software (MiSeq Reporter v 2.5.1 and GATK v2.3-9 ). This assay requires a minimum coverage of 200X, and has an analytic sensitivity of approximately 5%. The analytic sensitivity is dependent on the specific mutation and sequence context. All sequences are relative to the GRCh37 (hg19) genome. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: This assay is highly sensitive and accurate, but rare false positive and false negative results may occur. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is required. This assay may use reagents that are marked as ASR or RUO by the manufacturer. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by PathGroup. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA-88) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. This assay sequenced the following areas of the gene: portions of exons 18-21, consisting of codons 699-726, 729-840, 848-869 (specifically including codons E709, G719, S768, T790, L833, L858, L861 and deletions and insertions in exons 19 and 20). <BR/><BR/>Paez, J.
