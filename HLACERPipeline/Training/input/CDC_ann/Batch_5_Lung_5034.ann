The EGFR test methodology is a real-time PCR assay using the Qiagen EGFR RGQ kit. Mutations in exons 18, 19, 20, 21 of EGFR are included in the testing (exon 19 deletions, L858R, T790M, L861Q, G719X, S768I and exon 20 insertions) and the limit of detection is estimated to be 1-5%.\nThe laboratory follows strict quality assurance guidelines, but the chance of a false result due to laboratory errors incurred during any phase of testing cannot be completely excluded.\n\n\nPath report.microscopic observation\n\nMalignant cells with pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and delicate cytoplasm are present. The previous history of ovarian and breast carcinomas is noted.\nImmunostain results:\nPositive stains - TTF-1, napsin, p53, and ER (weak positive)\nNegative stains - CK20, CDX2, surfactant A, ALK, PAX8, WT-1, GATA, BRST2, and mammaglobin\nThe cytologic appearance and immunoprofile are most consistent with a primary lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nLeft upper lobe mass\nFellow: O.

However, some mutations may not be detectable by immunohistochemistry.\nMolecular testing for EGFR mutation has been ordered, and will be reported separately in an addendum by the Molecular Pathology Laboratory when the results are available.\n\n\n"
