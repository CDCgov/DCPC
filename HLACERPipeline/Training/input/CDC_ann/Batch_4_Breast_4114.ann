Negative for malignancy.\n\n\nPath report.microscopic examination\n\nAll sections examined, including multiple additional deeper levels from both blocks. The breast tissue is relatively atrophic, the most prominent finding being cystic ducts containing prominent calcifications, in which the epithelial lining is generally attenuated and bland, or absent altogether; the lumens filled with large and/or multiple dystrophic calcifications and/or foamy histiocytes; and the surrounding stroma being sclerotic and inflamed. Many of these changes are suggestive of duct ectasia. Some such ducts contain usual ductal hyperplasia. However, a rare duct contains epithelium (of relatively low grade, with reactive changes) that shows partial cribriforming, a feature associated with atypical ductal hyperplasia, but difficult to classify in this setting. High grade nuclear atypia or comedonecrosis are not observed, and there is no evidence of invasion. However, the atypia, albeit focal and of uncertain classification, in the context of this patient's history of contralateral invasive and in-situ ductal carcinoma, is cause for concern. Clinical/ radiographic correlation is needed and, if indicated, excisional biopsy may be considered. Other findings include mild fibrocystic changes (usual ductal hyperplasia, apocrine metaplasia/microcysts, adenosis, fibrosis), focal columnar cell change, and smaller intraluminal microcalcifications.\n\n\nPath report.site of origin\n\nLeft breast cores upper outer quadrant\n\n\nPath report.comments\n\nComments - Clinical/ radiographic correlation is needed.\n\n\n"
