It consists of a colonic segment (15.5 cm in length  12 cm in circumference), ileum (6 cm in length  4 cm in circumference, appendix (6 cm in length  0.6 cm in diameter) and attached mesenteric soft tissue.  The serosal surface is generally smooth and portions of it are marked with dye.  The bowel segment is opened revealing a large polypoid tumor having a somewhat lobular configuration measuring 6.5 5.5 cm which is located 7 cm from the ileal resection margin and about 8.5 cm from the colonic resection margin.  Adjacent to the tumor and located about 7 cm distal to the ileal resection margin is a kinked region of the bowel wall associated with a region of apparent intussusception involving an area measuring about 1.5-2 cm in length.  The tumor is located 7 cm from the mesenteric resection margin.  Section through the mass reveals some areas of possible superficial invasion of the muscularis propria but no involvement of the serosa or pericolonic adipose grossly.  Remainder of the colonic mucosa away from the mass has several separate small polyps located 6, 10 and 13 cm distal to the ileal resection margin measuring 0.6 0.5 0.3, 1.2 1.2 0.5 and 0.6 0.5 0.4 cm respectively.  The colonic wall distal to the polypoid tumor is markedly edematous and thickened.  The appendix and portion of ileum are unremarkable.  Several lymph nodes are identified within the attached pericolic soft tissues. Representative sections including an estimated two thirds of the large polypoid mass are submitted as follows: En face sections of ileal, colonic and mesenteric resection margins A1, A2 and A3 respectively, appendix A4, paired sets of sections including the tip and underlying base of the tumor are designated A5-A6, A7-A8, A9-A10, A11-A12, A13-A14, A15-A16 and A17-A18, 2 small polyps in their entirety located 6 and 13 cm distal to ileal resection margin A19 and A20 respectively, entire separate intermediate size polyp 10 cm distal to ileal resection margin (step sectioned) A21-A23, kinked region of bowel associated with area of apparent intussusception A24 and several possible mesenteric lymph nodes in their entirety A25-A28.

NRAS Mutation Detection by PCR-SNAPSHOT Analysis   INTERPRETATION:    Negative - No evidence of NRAS mutations was detected in codons 12, 13, 59, 60, 61, 117 and 146 of exons 2, 3 and 4 Indication for Study:   Adenocarcinoma Specimen Type:     Paraffin-Embedded Tissue-Right Colon Comments: Results should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and other laboratory findings for the most accurate interpretation. Samples with results reported as \"no mutation detected\" may harbor NRAS mutations that are not detected by the assay. NRAS is a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein involved in downstream receptor signaling which is critical for cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Mutations in the NRAS oncogene are frequently found in human cancers. They are seen in melanoma (\\R\\18%), colorectal cancer (\\R\\2%), hematopoietic and lymphoid cancer (\\R\\10%), and thyroid cancer (8%). This assay will detect NRAS mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 (see mutation list below). Recent NCCN guidelines have recommended that anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab for the first-line treatment be given only to patients who are negative for both KRAS and NRAS mutations. NRAS mutations are found in approximately 1-6% of colorectal cancer. See Molecular report MKF17-000421 for further information.

Perry Chan, Ph.D., MBA DABMG, DABCC, DLMcm, M(ASCP)cm, MB(ASCP)cm Methodology: Genomic DNA was isolated from the provided tumor specimen. Exons 2, 3 and 4 of the NRAS gene were subjected to SNaPshot multiplex PCR and primer extension for mutation detection. This assay is able to detect 5% mutation in a background of wild-type DNA. Intended Use: The detection of a NRAS mutation aids in identification of patients with worse prognosis and who may not respond to certain cancer therapies. References: 1.
