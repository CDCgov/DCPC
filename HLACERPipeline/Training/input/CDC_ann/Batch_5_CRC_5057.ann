Is this a metastatic deposit, if it bleeds, is radiation feasible? Case for MCC.\n\n\nPath report.microscopic observation\n\n\nThe original slides only are examined.\n\nThese biopsies from the colon at 40 cm show poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features, infiltrating the lamina propria and lymphatics. No background precursor dysplastic lesion is seen. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells show positivity for CK20, but appear negative for CK7. The tumour is lost on the deepest levels.\n\nComment\n\nNote is made from the HOSPITAL Healthcare Alliance - HOSPITAL Site pathology report that the patient has a history of cecal adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features, originally diagnosed and treated elsewhere in 2015. Thus, the findings in the current biopsies from the colon at 40 cm seem most consistent with a metastasis from the patient's previous proximal colon cancer.\n\nThis case has been reviewed at Departmental Gastrointestinal Pathology Rounds (with Drs. Driman, Walsh, Chakrabarti). The opinion rendered in this report represents the consensus opinion from these rounds.\n\n\n"
