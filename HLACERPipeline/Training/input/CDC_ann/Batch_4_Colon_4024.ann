It consists of a right colectomy\n specimen comprised of a segment of terminal ileum (11.3 cm in length x 3\n cm in average diameter) cecum/right colon (21.5 cm in length and ranging\n from 3.5-6.5 cm in diameter) with a moderate amount of attached, focally\n congested and ragged adipose tissue along its length. Both margins are\n stapled and appear viable. The serosa is mottled purple-tan-pink with\n hyperemia, cautery and adhesions at the cecum (inked blue). A 2 x 1.5\n cm tan-pink, firm mass with central ulceration is identified surrounding\n the appendiceal orifice, adjacent to the ileocecal valve, 11.5 cm from\n the closest proximal bowel margin, greater than 15 cm from the distal\n bowel margin, and approximately 5 cm from the distal colonic mesenteric\n resection margin. On cut section, the mass is tan-white, firm, focally\n hyperemic and friable and appears to extend through the mucosa and\n muscularis propria into the bowel wall and adipose tissue and abuts the\n serosa (inked blue). The mass obstructs the appendiceal orifice but\n does not appear to involve the appendix. Tan-white dense fibrous tissue\n is also surrounding the mass and the appendiceal wall. The appendix\n (approximately 3.5 cm in length by 1.2 cm in diameter) is lined by tan,\n soft mucosa and filled with green tan turbid mucoid material. No\n discrete masses, perforations or fecaliths identified.\n The uninvolved mucosa is tan, soft, glistening and well folded\n throughout the tan, rubbery wall averages 0.7 cm thick. No additional\n discrete lesions identified. Multiple palpable lymph node candidates\n (0.2-1.3 cm in greatest dimension) are identified. Representative\n sections, to include the majority of the mass, are submitted as labeled:\n A: Proximal bowel margin, en face\n B: Distal bowel margin, en face\n C: Mesocolonic mesenteric resection margin closest to mass (en face) and\n one inked and bisected lymph node candidate\n D: Mass surrounding the appendiceal orifice with adjacent ileocecal\n valve\n E-F: Mass with underlying appendix and closest serosa\n G: Mass to one half of distal tip of the appendix\n H: 9 lymph nodes candidates, in toto\n I: 11 lymph node candidates, in toto\n J: 5 lymph node candidates (2 differentially inked and bisected)\n K: 3 bisected lymph node candidates (2 differentially inked)\n\n\nPath report.relevant Hx\n\nClinical - 64 year old female, malignant neoplasm of cecum.

Dr. Fred has reviewed the case\n and concurs with the above diagnoses. Of note, invasive adenocarcinoma\n also shows microscopic extension with desmoplastic stromal reaction\n focally abutting the inked serosa on slide E. Despite tumor cells not\n touching the ink (less than 0.5 mm) on this particular H and E level, some\n would consider this finding equivalent to focal microscopic serosal\n involvement and pT4.\n\n\n"
