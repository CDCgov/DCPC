Received fresh in a container labeled with the patient's name, date of birth, and \"right sentinel node #1 3498\" is a 2 g, 2.4 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm aggregate of yellow to pink fibroadipose tissue and associated blue-purple lymph node. Excess fibroadipose tissue is cut away and the specimen is bisected to show lymph node parenchyma ranging from tan-pink and glistening to more firm and tan-yellow, to blue-purple colored with ink. A touch preparation is performed and a representative section is submitted for frozen section diagnosis. Summary of sections: FS1, 1/1. The remainder of the tissue is submitted for formalin fixation and permanent processing. The remainder of the specimen is submitted in cassettes 1A-B, A 4/1, B 3/1. 2. Container 2 is labeled as \", left total mastectomy, 2 short superior and 2 long lateral.\" Received in formalin is a 696 g breast with attached orientations sutures and no attached axillary tissue. The specimen measures 18.0 cm superior to inferior, 17.0 cm medial to lateral and up to 4.8 cm anterior to posterior. Attached to the anterior surface of the specimen is a 9.5 x 7.0 cm slightly irregular shaped triangular piece of tan skin with a 1.3 cm in diameter nipple with surrounding areola. The skin surface displays no discernible lesions. The margins are inked as follows: Anterosuperior-blue, anteroinferior-green, and posterior-black. Serially sectioning the specimen reveals yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue throughout with no lesions or gross abnormalities. Further sectioning and palpating the most lateral tissue reveals no identifiable lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 1A, nipple and areola; 1B, subareolar tissue; 1C-D, upper inner quadrant; 1E-F, lower inner quadrant; 1G-H, upper outer quadrant; 1I-J, lower outer quadrant. (AAC/csb) 3. Container 3 is labeled as \", right total mastectomy, 2 short superior and 2 long lat.\" Received in formalin is a 685 g breast with attached orientation sutures and no attached axillary tail. The specimen measures 17.5 cm superior to inferior, 19.0 cm medial to lateral and up to 4.5 cm anterior to posterior. The anterior surface displays an attached, slightly irregular shaped triangular piece of tan skin measuring 10.5 x 7.5 cm with a 1.2 cm in nipple displaying surrounding areola. No skin surface lesions are identified. The margins are inked as follows: Anterosuperior-blue, anteroinferior-green and posterior-black. Serially sectioning the specimen reveals yellow-tan fibrofatty tissue. Located in the upper and lower outer quadrants is an ill-defined granular suspicious area measuring approximately 7.0 cm medial to lateral, up to 5.0 cm superior to inferior, and 3.5 cm anterior to posterior. The suspicious granular area focally approaches the anterosuperior margin, measures 2.5 cm from the posterior margin, and 4.5 cm from the anteroinferior margin. The suspicious tissue does not approach the anterior skin. No additional suspicious areas are identified. Within the more fibrous areas are small fluid filled cysts measuring up to 0.4 cm in greatest dimension. Further sectioning and palpating the most lateral tissue reveals no identifiable lymph nodes. Representative sections are submitted as follows: 3A, nipple and areola; 3B, subareolar tissue; 3C-J, sections from the granular suspicious area, submitted sequentially from medial to lateral; 3K-L, the granular suspicious area including the closest areas of the anterosuperior margin; 3M, closest portion of the posterior margin to the granular suspicious area; 3N, grossly uninvolved upper inner quadrant; 3O, grossly uninvolved lower inner quadrant; 3P, grossly uninvolved upper outer quadrant; 3Q, grossly uninvolved lower outer quadrant.

Breast, left, total mastectomy:     Benign lobular breast parenchyma showing no evidence of atypical epithelial       hyperplasia or malignancy.     Mild fibrocystic changes.     Focal ductal epithelial hyperplasia without atypia. 3. Breast, right, total mastectomy:     Infiltrating mammary carcinoma, ductal type, low-grade by combined histologic       grading (nuclear grade 2, architectural grade 2, mitotic index 1), 1.6 cm in       area of greatest diameter.     Associated extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, solid and cribriform type,       intermediate nuclear grade with areas of central necrosis.     Ductal carcinoma in situ shows focal lobular extension.     Margins of resection negative for in-situ and invasive carcinoma.

FISH Comments - The HER2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) did not reveal amplification of the HER2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 1.04 and a Her2 copy number of 2.08, (ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number <4), indicating absence of amplification. There was no evidence of polysomy/polyploidy or genetic heterogeneity. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
