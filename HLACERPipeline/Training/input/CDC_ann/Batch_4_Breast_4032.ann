The larger fragment measures 6.5 cm greatest dimension, thus, the neoplasm is estimated to be at least 6.5 cm in greatest dimension. In some areas features suggestive of squamous differentiation are noted, however, no definitive keratin or intercellular bridges are identified. Sarcomatous features are not seen. The neoplasm demonstrates poorly differentiated features and marked nuclear pleomorphism with scattered tumor giant cells. The grade is based on a score of 9 of 9 (glandular/tubular/acinar differentiation - 3, nuclear pleomorphism - 3, mitotic rate -3). See below for prognostic markers results. Prospective QA review done by Dr. J R Slemmer. FISH Comments - The HER-2 FISH assay (Abbott Molecular/Vysis, Inc.) revealed amplification of the HER-2 oncogene. A ratio of HER-2 gene signals to the centromeric control probe of chromosome 17 (CEP 17) signals was 2.20 and a Her2 copy number of 7.32, (ratio greater or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number >6), indicating amplification. In addition, 84% of cells showed 3 or more copies of both the chromosome 17 centromere (D17Z1) and HER2 probes, suggesting that polysomy or polyploidy may be present in this specimen. Clinical correlation is recommended.    A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number less than 4 indicates absence of amplification.  A ratio less than 2.0 and Her2 copy number greater or equal to 4 and less than 6 indicates an equivocal value and per ASCO/CAP guidelines, requires reflex to another (IHC for Her2) test.  A ratio greater than or equal to 2.0 or average Her2 copy number greater or equal to 6 indicates gene amplification.    Regions of invasive tumor were defined by a pathologist. The tumor was fixed in formalin (recommended 6-72hrs). Tumor fixed outside the recommended fixation time should be interpreted with caution. Controls were performed and provided the anticipated results. This case has been reviewed by at least 2 observers.\n\n\n"
