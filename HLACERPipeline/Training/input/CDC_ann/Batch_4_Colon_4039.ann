COMMENT: Immunohistochemical analysis (performed on representative tumor tissue) per EGAPP recommendations reveals intact nuclear staining for DNA mismatch repair enzymes (MLH-1, MSH-2, MSH-6 and PMS-2 protein expression is present in both the tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue components). These results fail to show evidence for defective mismatch repair function or Lynch syndrome and are approximately 95% sensitive for Lynch syndrome. Cancers with this profile are microsatellite stable (MSS). If clinical suspicion is very high for Lynch syndrome (or other hereditary cancer syndromes, such as attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis) despite this negative result on the screening test, then consideration could be made for a genetic consult with additional testing. [References available on request].\n\n\nPath report.supplemental reports\n\nAncillary Report: Immunoperoxidase staining was performed and evaluated with appropriate controls. Tumor cells are positive for CDX2. CDX2 expression has important prognostic value in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Loss of CDX2 expression is associated with an aggressive clinical course including infiltrative growth, and advanced T, N, M and overall stage.
