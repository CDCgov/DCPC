Rearrangement of the ALK gene most often corresponds to the t(2;5)(p23;q35) and its variants. It is a recurring abnormality in anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and recent data demonstrate that the ALK gene is also rearranged in approximately 5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients who are positive for ALK rearrangement (greater than or equal to 15% of cells with the rearrangement) have been shown in clinical trials to respond positively to the FDA approved crizotinib. Of the ALK-rearrangement positive cells, 80% (24% of total cells) revealed additional 3` ALK signals and 20% (6% of total cells) revealed an additional fusion signal.\n \n  Monitoring for this anomaly may be useful in assessing the patient`s remission/relapse status.\n \n  FISH analysis revealed no ROS1 (6q22.1) gene rearrangement. However, it should be noted that the FISH probes utilized in this analysis cannot entirely exclude the presence of other chromosomal abnormalities. Correlation with other clinical and morphological data is recommended, if available.\n \n  FISH analysis was performed on interphase cells using the following multiplex probes:\n  ALK Breakapart (5`ALK; 3`ALK) - FDA Approved (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)\n  ROS1 Breakapart (5`ROS1; 3`ROS1) (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Des Plaines, IL)\n \n  References:\n  Nat Med. 2012 Feb 12;18(3):382-4; Oncol Rep. 2012 Oct;28(4):1187-92; J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 1;27(10):1667-74.
