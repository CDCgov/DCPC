**What it does**


Earlier version of the LAPPS Serialization API had a bug that produced ``null`` values for some fields.  Typically this would not be a problem, except for another bug that resulted in ``AmbiguousMethodCall`` exceptions in the ``org.lappsgrid.serialization.lif.Annotation`` constructor when it encountered these ``null`` values.

The ``Sanitize LIF`` tool will remove these ``null`` values from the input LIF document so tools compiled with the older API libraries will be able to load them without throwing an exception.
