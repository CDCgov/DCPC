Adds identity relations between previously identified named entities in order to perform coreference.

.. class:: infomark

**NOTE**: If input is from to this tools is the output of a pipeline of GATE tools including *GATE->GATE Gazetteer* and *GATE->GATE: NamedEntityRecognizer*, the 
Orthomatcher may assign an entity type to an unclassiﬁed proper name (an "Unknown"" annotation), using the type of a matching name. 

**Required Annotations**

* Named Entities generated by  *GATE->GATE: NamedEntityRecognizer* OR `NamedEntity <http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/NamedEntity>`_ 

**Generated Annotations**

* A list of annotation IDs for annotations referring to the same entity as the value of the *matches* feature of any named entity annotation.`
If converted to LIF using *Convert Formats->GateToLif*, the output will include NamedEntity <http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/NamedEntity>`_ 
annotations with a list of annotation IDs for annotations referring to the same entity as the value of the *matches* feature.
