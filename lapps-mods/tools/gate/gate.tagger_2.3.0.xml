**What it does**

A modiﬁed version of the Brill tagger, which produces a part-of-speech tag as an annotation on each Token. 


**Required Annotations**

* Tokens in GATE XML format (will automatically convert from LIF)
* Sentences in GATE XML format (will automatically convert from LIF)

**Generated Annotations**

* Token annotations in `GATE XML format <https://gate.ac.uk/sale/tao/splitch5.html#x8-1000005.5.2>`_ with part of speech from the Penn tagset given on the "category" feature.

.. class:: infomark

If converted to `LIF <http://wiki.lappsgrid.org/org.lappsgrid.serialization/groovydoc/org/lappsgrid/serialization/lif/Container.html>`_, the output will include 
`Token <http://vocab.lappsgrid.org/Token.html>`_ annotations with an added "pos" feature indicating the token's part of speech.

.. class:: warningmark

The output of all GATE tools is in the `GATE XML format <https://gate.ac.uk/sale/tao/splitch5.html#x8-1000005.5.2>`_. This output can be input directly into other GATE tools. To input GATE XML format to  tools requiring LIF, 
use *Convert formats->GateToLif*
