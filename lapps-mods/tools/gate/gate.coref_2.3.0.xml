**What it does**

The pronominal coreference module performs anaphora resolution.

For each pronoun (anaphor) the coreference module generates an annotation of type "Coreference" containing two features:

* *antecedent oﬀset*: oﬀset of the starting node for the annotation (entity) which is proposed as the antecedent, or null if no antecedent can be proposed.
* *matches*: a list of annotation IDs that comprise the coreference chain comprising this anaphor/antecedent pair.


**Required Annotations**
 
The module depends on the following annotations created from the respective GATE modules:

* GATE->GATE Tokenizer
* GATE->GATE SentenceSplitter
* GATE->GATE POSTagger
* GATE->GATE OrthoMatcher
* GATE->GATE NamedEntityRecognizer


**Generated Annotations**

* *antecedent oﬀset*: oﬀset of the starting node for the annotation (entity) which is proposed as the antecedent, or null if no antecedent can be proposed.
