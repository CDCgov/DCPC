                <p>There are four cancer pathology pipeline demos. They illustrate how NLP rule based and machine learning solutions work. View how the input of unstructured data is analyzed along with the output produced.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you are new to NLP before viewing the demos, consider first familiarizing yourself with <a href="nlp.html">NLP Basics</a>.</li>

                    <li>Cancer Pathology is an available service with four pipeline solutions. Learn about the use case it addresses,
                        how the service is built and how to use any of the three available solutions. Go to <a href="service-cancer-pathology.html">cancer pathology service</a>.

                        <p>Note that "Metadata" is at the top of the file. Metadata is not processed through the pipeline, however, it is important. It is used by the pathology laboratory to supply information about the content needed for the management of the pathology that does not refer to the clinical content itself. It contains identification of the patient, the pathology service, time and date stamps for different actions taken in completing the report plus a brief summary. Different laboratories will insert different information in the metadata so it has a variable structure.</p>
