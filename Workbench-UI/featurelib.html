            <p>Use the workbench feature library software to build a language model for any of the available CLEW
                services that uses machine learning.</p>

            <p>To train a machine learning model you must identify natural characteristics or "features" for each token.
                These features include, for example, word length, part-of-speech, and relative location in the
                sentence.</p>

            <p>With the feature library you can readily identify a set of features for each token in a training corpus,
                a manually annotated set of documents. These identified features and documents are then input into the
                pipeline. Next, analyze the pipeline output. If the pipeline performed accurately the model is trained
                and the pipeline is ready for production. Any taggings of the corpus that do not match the manual
                annotations in the Gold Standard represent a disparity in the process. Go back and adjust the features
                and repeat the process.</p>

            <h2>How to use the Feature Library</h2>

            <p>The Feature Library can be used inside LAPPS for a single file or as an external service for a folder of
                files.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Use inside LAPPS: The Feature Library is a service in LAPPS that can be inserted at the end of an NLP
                    pipeline the user has assembled. After inserting the Feature Library in the pipeline, when a file is
                    submitted for processing the BIO file will be generated at the completion of all the processing. It can
                    then be downloaded to the users desktop using the LAPPS download function.
                </li>
                <li>Use for Bulk File Processing: When a folder of files needs to be processed, the Feature Library can be
                    accessed via CLEW.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Open the feature library to <a href="http://ec2-18-213-219-240.compute-1.amazonaws.com/clew/feature_library/main" target="_blank" >use the Feature Library for bulk file processing</a>.</li>
                <li>Select required parameters values.</li>
                <li>Use the Lapps upload function.</li>
                <li>CLEW will then access the files and process them through the Feature Library and produce an output BIO
                    file that will be lodged in the users Downloads folder.
                </li>
                <li>The user can then directly input the BIO file into their preferred machine learning algorithm.</li>
                <li>The output will be a language model that is then available for tagging files.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Example</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To train a machine learning model for the safety surveillance data, the following types of features for each token in the text was identified and implemented.</li>

                <li>Word length: the length of the word</li>

                <li>Part-of-speech (POS): grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation</li>

                <li>Features extracted from MetaMapLite such as semantic types</li>

                <li>Features extracted from NCBO web service such as preferred terms</li>

                <li>Features extracted from ETHER lexicon (dictionary mapping in the lexicon)</li>

                <li>Features of adjacent tokens: POS/pattern/Stem features of tokens before/after the current token</li>

                <li>Heuristic features extracted based on ETHER rules. As an example, a token of interest next to Dx/Diagnosis is treated as Primary Diagnosis, while a token of interest next to “cause of death” or “COD” is a good indicator of Cause of Death.</li>

                <li>Word stem (the stem of the word)</li>

                <li>Pattern extracted based on the Unicode categories of each of the character in the text <sup>1</sup></li>

                <li>Relative location in the sentence</li>
            </ul>
            <small><sup>1</sup> http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr49/tr49-2.html</small>

            <p>Among these features, we selected and evaluated the performance of different combinations of categories.</p>
