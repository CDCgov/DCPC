                <h2 id="overview">CLEW Overview</h2>

                <p>CLEW is an effort to introduce Language Engineering into the broader public health and PCORI
                    communities. The CLEW efforts follow on from the earlier research community’s efforts best
                    represented by the various participants in the AMIA NLP User Group and the precedence established by
                    GATE.</p>

                <p>CLEW provides technology and a framework to better and more easily design and plan a targeted and
                    sophisticated clinical language-processing objective.</p>

                <p>With the emergence of computational linguistics into a widespread discipline of interest,
                    particularly in the European Union, there is an effort to move beyond just research, and to create a
                    systematic approach to the development of NLP applications. This work is now identifiable as Natural
                    Language Engineering and is best represented by the GATE project.</p>

                <p>CLEW is founded in the principles of Computational Linguistics because the crude methods of text
                    mining are not normally sufficient to achieve an accuracy that is productive and sufficiently safe
                    for carrying out the critical research and analytics of the Public Health and PCORI communities. The
                    clinical language space requires a sophisticated language processing approach as offered with
                    methods grounded in computational linguistics.</p>

                <h2 id="concepts">Key CLEW Concepts</h2>
                <h3>Interoperability</h3>
                <p>CLEW is underpinned by the LAPPS technology which is built to enable cross-linking of NLP modules
                    from different computational linguistics open source contributors.</p>

                <p>One of the aims of the LAPPS environment is its capacity to make modules from different open source
                    NLP development projects interoperable. LAPPS is an interface where many modules from various NLP
                    projects can be linked into a single pipeline to assess their processing effects. So a tokenizer
                    from one system can be paired with a POS-tagger from another system. This interoperability is
                    achieved by the creation of the LIF* standardized data sharing format so that outputs from one
                    module are converted into a LIF format ready for use in any other module. On involving another
                    module the LIF format is converted into the input format needed for that module. Hence LIF
                    represents a lingua franca for the transfer of data from one module to another without needing
                    special translation tools.</p>

                <p><small>*LIF = LAPPS Interchange Format<br>
                    (a format used to transport data between LAPPS services, see CLEW Instance of the LAPPS Grid below)</small></p>

                <h3>Community sharing</h3>
                <p>The CLEW is engineered to be an environment for members of the clinical NLP community to share their
                    experience and assist others to achieve successful language processing goals. The LAPPS assists in
                    designing and testing pipelines and gives starter systems to the community to quickly learn the
                    complexities of the NLP task.</p>

                <p>It then provides a platform for using solutions as a service so that projects can start up
                    immediately using an already established CLEW service or identify users for their own services
                    knowing a community of practice is available to assist them at will.</p>

                <h3>Experimentation and refinement of clinical models</h3>
                <p>Firstly CLEW supports a project team to build a clinical processing language model. Subsequently,
                    CLEW supports experimentation with the model to identify its weaknesses and improve its performance
                    with the ability to mix and match processing modules from different NLP paradigms and a ready
                    mechanism to select and trial various feature combinations.</p>

                <p>The real work of building an NLP service lies in the experimentation to make it work at maximum
                    accuracy. It is always easy to get something working to a moderate standard but it requires serious
                    attention to detail to achieve an accuracy that represents a significant efficiency benefit to a
                    working process.</p>

                <h3>Services</h3>
                <p>A service is a computer program that can be called from a program running on another computer. The
                    machine wanting to use the service sends it a message along with the texts it wants processed. The
                    Service computer analyses the message and sends back the requested information. The first CDC
                    service accepts a pathology report and returns a list of all the clinical entities it has found in
                    the report. The second CDC service accepts the list of clinical entities and codes them ICD O3.</p>

                <p>The first services to be provided in the CLEW are a pathology text coding service to convert text to
                    ICD O3 codes. This consists of two sub-services that firstly extract relevant clinical concepts from
                    a pathology report and then codify those extractions.</p>

                <h2 id="grid">CLEW Instance of the LAPPS Grid</h2>
                <p>The LAPPS grid is a development environment created by a team at Vassar University to enable a
                    process of experimentation with different open source NLP pipelines. LAPPS is built using the Galaxy
                    Platform <sup>1</sup></p>

                <p>The user interface in LAPPS makes it easy for an NLP experimenter to plug and play with different
                    components from different NLP open source projects and therefore encourages development and
                    experimentation by project teams wanting to engage in engineering NLP production lines. The service
                    model created in the CLEW encourages the sharing of the production lines with other user communities.</p>

The Galaxy team is a part of BX at Penn State, and the Biology and Mathematics and Computer Science departments at Emory University.

                <h2 id="library">Feature Library</h2>
                <p>The Feature Library is the mechanism by which features can be invoked to be used in the development of a Language Model. It is initially primed with a range of features commonly used in SNLP applications. So expect over time it will be enhanced by new users who develop applications that require specialized feature sets. Having a single place to accumulate these feature generating applications will contribute to the whole Language Engineering community having greater resources at their disposal.</p>
