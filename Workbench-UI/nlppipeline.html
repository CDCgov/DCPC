                    forms a pipeline where the output of one module becomes the input to another. In this section, learn

                    <h2>What is a Software Pipeline?</h2>
                    <p>In software engineering, a pipeline consists of a chain of processing elements where the output
                        of each element is the input of the next - this process is similar to an assembly line.</p>
                    <p>NLP is a complex task, however, NLP solutions can be broken into a number of steps where each
                        step can be addressed independently and solved separately by different specialists. In addition,
                        this separation of function is important for maintaining software that has different functions
                        but also because experimental work is needed on each of these functions independently of each
                        other. This makes a pipeline a natural solution where the output of one step in the chain is the
                        input of the next step in the chain.</p>

                    <h2>A Typical NLP Pipeline</h2>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>

                    <h3>Tokeniser</h3>
                    <p>A typical NLP pipeline needs to begin with identifying the basic building blocks of language,
                        usually understood as words. In written text there are items besides words that carry
                        information such as numbers, punctuation, abbreviations and acronyms. The total collection of
                        words and other items in written text are called tokens.</p>
                    <p>A token is typically defined as any collection of characters between whitespace. This is not
                        strictly true as separate tokens can be connected across certain characters such as the digits
                        either side of a decimal point or words joined by a hyphen. The process of identifying the basic
                        elements of a text is called tokenisation and developers can differ in their determination of
                        tokens based on the domain and text being analyzed.</p>

                    <h3>Sentence Boundary Detector (SBD)</h3>
                    <h4>(also known as Sentence Splitter)</h4>
                    <p>Once the Tokenizer has done its work it is essential to separate the text into sentences. This
                        step of the pipeline is known as a sentence boundary detector (SBD) or a sentence splitter. It
                        is common to understand the end of a sentence is defined by a full stop followed by a whitespace
                        followed by a Capital letter. However, this is not always the case especially in clinical text
                        where fullstops are often omitted, new sentences can be defined by a newline indented in from
                        the left margin with or without a bullet point marker. As with the Tokenizer the SBD may need to
                        be tailored to match the nature of the text being analyzed.</p>

                    <h3>Part of Speech Tagger (POS)</h3>
                    <p>Once the sentences are defined it is often helpful to identify the Part of Speech (POS) each
                        token is serving in a sentence. This process can be achieved by looking up words in a dictionary
                        or applying a grammatical parser. Either way the processor has to deal with unknown tokens, that
                        is tokens which are not present in the processing system lexicon. It is typical of POS taggers
                        to assign Noun to any unknown words but that may not be adequate for some applications.</p>

                    <h3>Chunker</h3>
                    <p>After the POS Tagger, pipelines can diverge in many directions depending on the need. Typically
                        if the task is to identify entities or concepts in the text then a simple parsing process called
                        chunking can be applied. This is a process that divides a sentence of words into groupings
                        typically representative of clauses and phrases. This is not a full grammatical parser but a
                        simpler approximation.</p>

                    <h3>Application Specific Processing</h3>
                    <p>After the Chunking step, the pipeline will diverge into application specific processing. In
                        clinical entity recognition, the chunks could be passed to a semantic recognition module, which
                        can identify clinical phrases such as names of diseases, procedures and body sites, or into a
                        machine learning induced language model designed to recognize specific types of entities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Rules for recognizing particular chunks of text can be inserted at different
                        points throughout the pipeline depending on other dependencies in the solution design.</p>

                <div id="performance">
                    <h2>Pipeline Performance & Accuracy</h2>
                    <p>Building a pipeline for practical use in the workplace requires understanding how accurately it
                        performs. If it is not sufficiently accurate it may be a hindrance rather than a help in the
                        workplace. Many simple NLP tasks can be built quickly but usually such solutions have limited
                        accuracy and only perform at 70-80% accuracy. The effort of increasing the accuracy above 80% is
                        normally substantial where the effort increases logarithmically the higher the performance. This
                        means the effort to get from 80% to 90% accuracy will be substantial then twice that again to
                        get to 95% and twice that again to get to 97.5%. It is unheard of for applications to reach
                        above the 97.5% level if they are performing a complicated task.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Accuracy is Measured in Three Major Ways</h3>
                <p>The design and implementation of performance evaluation mechanisms is a key component in the NLP Web
                    Service platform and workbench. Three common methods to measure accuracy are listed below.</p>
                <p>1. Ten-fold cross validation (10CV)<br>
                    Ten-fold cross validation involves dividing the training corpus into 10 sections, training the system
                    on nine-tenths and then testing it on the tenth. This is repeated 10 time each time holding out a
                    different one-tenth. The final accuracy is the average of the ten determinations.</p>

                <p>2. Held out data set (HODS)<br>
                    Held out data set requires developing a separate corpus of records by the client which the developer
                    never sees. When the pipeline development has reached a suitable stage the client tests it against
                    their held out data set and reports back to the development team the accuracy of the results.</p>

                <p>3. Self test (ST)<br>
                    Self test is the simplest method where the texts used to build the pipeline are assessed for how
                    accurately they match they computed outputs. Although this method is not considered acceptable by
                    researchers its value is that it gives a first approximation on the accuracy of the system and so
                    has great practical value in identifying weaknesses in the processing stream.</p>

                <p>Each method has its strengths and weaknesses although the Held out data set gives the client more
                    confidence in the quality of the product they are receiving as they are the ones conducting the
                    independent tests.</p>

                <h4>Gold Standard</h4>
                <p>All three accuracy methods, Ten-fold cross validation, Held out data set and Self test, require the
                    preparation of a Gold Standard (GS) where the correct results are known.</p>

                <p>Preparing a Gold Standard is a time consuming task. Most applications are only tested on a small
                    subset of the content they potentially have to process. This incomplete testing can quickly lead to
                    disappointment in a NLP application if client expectations are not well managed. As needed an
                    iterative revision process must be carefully planned and executed.</p>

                <h4>Machine Rules Fusion</h4>
                <p><strong>Machine</strong> learning methods and <strong>Rule</strong>-based methods have strengths and weaknesses. For the safety
                    surveillance data processing, a method was adopted to <strong>combine</strong> the outputs from ETHER (a rule-based
                    system) and the machine learning model (CRF/LibSVM).</p>
                <p>As an example of the strength of this approach, the machine learning models missed many VACCINE or
                    DRUG annotations, while ETHER, the rule-based system, performed much better since its lexicon covers
                    most of the vaccines and drugs. A method was adopted to use VACCINE/DRUG outputs with ETHER outputs
                    in place of machine learning outputs, and the performance was significantly improved.</p>
