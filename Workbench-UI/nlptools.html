            <h2>General NLP Tools</h2>

            <p>To support the development of a NLP workbench, we performed an environmental scan to identify open source NLP and machine learning tools that can analyze and code unstructured clinical text.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>First, we combined the results from a systematic Literature Review and a comprehensive Multi-Channel Review covering researchers and institutions, NLP challenges, and government activities.</li>
                <li>Next, we selected eligible tools on the basis of availability and relevance.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Availability - The tool is open-source, downloadable, and source code exists.</li>
                        <li>Relevance - The tool supports the processing of adverse event or pathology reports, it generates standardized and/or coded output, or is it equipped with advanced capabilities, such as the extraction of temporal information and the de-identification of personally identifiable information.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Lastly, these tools were evaluated on three aspects representing the importance and applicability of the tools: (1) development activity, (2) popularity, and (3) framework used.</li>
            </ul>
